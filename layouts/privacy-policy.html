        <li>To process payments (using a third-party payment processing vendor).</li>
        <li>To create and manage your account and/or membership</li>
        <li>To improve our websites, mobile applications, services, and product offerings.</li>
        <li>To conduct analytics and research.</li>
        <li>To communicate with you, such as to respond to and/or follow-up on your requests, inquiries, issues, or feedback.</li>
        <li>To send you electronic communications you have requested, such as text messages, push notifications, notifications through our mobile application  or through your mobile device.  </li>
        <li>To send marketing and promotional materials including information relating to our products, services, sales, or promotions, or those of our business partners.</li>

As a result, our collection and processing of your information is based in different contexts upon your consent, our need to perform a contract, our obligations under law, and/or our legitimate interest in conducting our business.</p>
      <p>To the extent we maintain and use personal information in a deidentified form, we will not attempt to reidentify the information, except for the purpose of determining whether our deidentification processes satisfy our legal obligations.</p>
