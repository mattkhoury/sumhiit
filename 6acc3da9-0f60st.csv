"The reason I noted Alex.","01:08","01:10",0,"Ben Camper"
"Not for this top two meeting, but for next top two meeting.","01:10","01:14",0,"Ben Camper"
"Alex, if you don't mind, can you walk the group through the ops package?","01:15","01:18",0,"Ben Camper"
"I believe it should be finished by then.","01:18","01:20",0,"Ben Camper"
"Perfect.","01:20","01:21",0,"Ben Camper"
"Awesome.","01:21","01:21",0,"Ben Camper"
"the group will have that in their inbox before I think some of you have always been on the ops package distro.","01:21","01:30",0,"Ben Camper"
"Others may not have.","01:30","01:31",0,"Ben Camper"
"You'll all have it moving forward.","01:31","01:33",0,"Ben Camper"
"Pretty data.","01:34","01:35",0,"Ben Camper"
"There's a lot of just numbers in the Excel.","01:37","01:40",0,"Ben Camper"
"So you'll have it.","01:40","01:42",0,"Ben Camper"
"There's a few initial tabs that are summary tabs, which are great, and I'll also walk our way through it.","01:42","01:49",0,"Ben Camper"

"Nigel gone there's.","02:01","02:04",2,"Nigel Skiathitis"
"Nigel just got booted out of our room.","02:04","02:09",2,"Nigel Skiathitis"
"So we're transitioning to a new spot.","02:09","02:11",2,"Nigel Skiathitis"
"We work somebody for us to pay the bill.","02:12","02:15",0,"Ben Camper"
"Time's up.","02:19","02:20",2,"Nigel Skiathitis"
"hey, I was just here with the group, so I put presale performance on there.","02:20","02:25",0,"Ben Camper"
"I'm not sure if you're I know you're working on a visual, but I meant to ping you on this offline.","02:25","02:30",0,"Ben Camper"
"If we've got it, great.","02:31","02:32",0,"Ben Camper"
"If not, we can scrap it.","02:33","02:35",0,"Ben Camper"
"I know you're thinking through a visual for presale performance.","02:36","02:39",0,"Ben Camper"
"Yeah, I still probably need another week with Alex on this.","02:39","02:43",2,"Nigel Skiathitis"
"We've sent across some ideas and where we are, and it's just building it into a usable kind of structure.","02:43","02:50",2,"Nigel Skiathitis"
"Cool.","02:51","02:51",0,"Ben Camper"
"Can you grab just share just presale numbers with everybody?","02:52","02:56",0,"Ben Camper"
"Anyways, when we get to it, we'll just go through them.","02:56","02:58",0,"Ben Camper"
"Cool.","02:59","02:59",0,"Ben Camper"
"We'll do department updates.","03:00","03:02",0,"Ben Camper"
"Matt, we got the product development, intake and prioritization review.","03:02","03:05",0,"Ben Camper"
"I've got four problem solving topics, including Nigel.","03:05","03:11",0,"Ben Camper"
"I got the added one you wanted to talk about with cancellation.","03:11","03:14",0,"Ben Camper"
"So that's the agenda for today.","03:14","03:18",0,"Ben Camper"
"Any questions or ads before we get going?","03:20","03:22",0,"Ben Camper"
"All right, month to date.","03:35","03:36",0,"Ben Camper"
"I got my note out from early in the morning, earlier in the morning.","03:36","03:44",0,"Ben Camper"
"it looks like last week we took a step backwards.","03:44","03:46",0,"Ben Camper"
"We lost about $1,000.","03:46","03:48",0,"Ben Camper"
"1st studio in AUVs.","03:48","03:50",0,"Ben Camper"
"We were hovering in the high 60 to we're in around 59.","03:50","03:57",0,"Ben Camper"
"So we took about $1,000 back.","03:58","04:00",0,"Ben Camper"
"When I look at studio to studio, a few of our studios, like our top maybe four or five, something like Berlin Game, Columbia, Pasadena, West Loop, it looks like they might have had, like, of variance.","04:00","04:17",0,"Ben Camper"
"Some of our middle tier studios lost maybe 1000, $2,000.","04:17","04:21",0,"Ben Camper"
"looks like that's where kind of it came from.","04:21","04:23",0,"Ben Camper"
"in the scheme of things, not a huge drop.","04:23","04:26",0,"Ben Camper"
"Right.","04:26","04:27",0,"Ben Camper"
"You obviously would love to be growing throughout the month, and that's what we expected to do because we've got.","04:27","04:33",0,"Ben Camper"
"The.","04:35","04:36",2,"Nigel Skiathitis"
"50% off promotions have kind of cycled through.","04:36","04:38",0,"Ben Camper"
"we think that's of tailwind for us in rate and so that we've got consumers paying us more.","04:38","04:43",0,"Ben Camper"
"Looks like our cancellations jumped up a bit.","04:43","04:46",0,"Ben Camper"
"on a per studio basis, cancellations are up, and then we just didn't sell as many new sales to kind of mitigate that.","04:46","04:52",0,"Ben Camper"
"that's what I attribute roughly the drop of about $1,000 from the prior week.","04:53","04:58",0,"Ben Camper"
"We've got the second half of the month to go, and so our traffic still looks pretty good.","04:59","05:06",0,"Ben Camper"
"We're still averaging roughly three trials per day, which is what we've been averaging for the better part of two and a half months.","05:06","05:11",0,"Ben Camper"
"That's enough trials to generate the type of sales we need.","05:11","05:16",0,"Ben Camper"
"on the traffic standpoint, nothing out there that seems like it's red alarm.","05:17","05:21",0,"Ben Camper"
"Conversion sits at 20%, so it's up over February, but still we're eight points behind and where we'd like to be our goal of 28.","05:22","05:30",0,"Ben Camper"
"you guys are probably hearing a broken record here.","05:31","05:34",0,"Ben Camper"
"That's been the pain point.","05:34","05:36",0,"Ben Camper"
"There's two things I want to kind of just let the group kind of in on and share with.","05:38","05:42",0,"Ben Camper"
"Many of you are involved in these conversations specifically, but it's not lost on us that almost every call outside of the January ones, we're like conversions off target, and we're trying to figure out why and how we improve it.","05:42","05:58",0,"Ben Camper"
"I think the ways that we're attacking this are the right ways currently.","05:58","06:05",0,"Ben Camper"
"we've rolled out a sales model that we believe in, that's gains.","06:05","06:10",0,"Ben Camper"
"We're working on driving execution.","06:11","06:13",0,"Ben Camper"
"We reinforce that every single week in the base camp beat.","06:13","06:17",0,"Ben Camper"
"If you look at the base camp beat today, it's on a very narrow section of gains.","06:17","06:21",0,"Ben Camper"
"If you looked at it last week, very narrow section of gains.","06:21","06:25",0,"Ben Camper"
"Conversion is of a freighter.","06:26","06:28",0,"Ben Camper"
"if you got to think about, in order for us to get better at conversion, team members have to get skilled up, right?","06:28","06:35",0,"Ben Camper"
"And so that takes some practice.","06:35","06:38",0,"Ben Camper"
"Like, think about how many times you're going to work with one team member in a week.","06:38","06:41",0,"Ben Camper"
"The student manager might only have, like, one rep with that person or two reps of that person, and certainly they're not going to get that much better after one or two reps.","06:41","06:48",0,"Ben Camper"
"It's a freighter.","06:50","06:51",0,"Ben Camper"
"We got to improve the skill sets of our team and the execution so that we can drive higher conversion.","06:51","06:57",0,"Ben Camper"
"I think that work is the right work.","06:57","06:59",0,"Ben Camper"
"Great job by the people involved with making that sales model, training that sales model, putting it on paper, scripting it out, and now we're just driving that execution, right?","07:00","07:11",0,"Ben Camper"
"We're driving it through our communication on the beat, through our in studio visits, calls, et cetera.","07:11","07:17",0,"Ben Camper"
"So that's tactic one.","07:17","07:19",0,"Ben Camper"
"Do I think tactic one is going to get us from 20% to 28%?","07:19","07:22",0,"Ben Camper"
"No, I think tactic one will help us move and improve.","07:23","07:26",0,"Ben Camper"
"there's some fundamental things with either the way consumers are looking at trials or our trial process in general that we're just going to have to start fishing for.","07:26","07:38",0,"Ben Camper"
"there's two things that are on our mind right now that are kind of in motion that would be fundamental changes.","07:39","07:46",0,"Ben Camper"
"the first is working towards a paid trial.","07:46","07:50",0,"Ben Camper"
"We'll probably test out in Berlin game.","07:50","07:51",0,"Ben Camper"
"We're still really early on and what that could look like.","07:52","07:54",0,"Ben Camper"
"There's a small group that's working through the logistics on it.","07:54","07:58",0,"Ben Camper"
"Think what would the price be, how does someone purchase it, how do we sell it, how do we run it just in one studio and not others?","07:58","08:07",0,"Ben Camper"
"I think we're not prepared to kind of go into bigger, broader depth of that today, but sometime let's call in the next two months, we should be in a place where we can test out a new type of trial process that's one.","08:08","08:21",0,"Ben Camper"
"number two is we're doing some price sensitivity testing as well on just our pricing.","08:21","08:27",0,"Ben Camper"
"obviously a big part of conversion is the price you pay.","08:27","08:32",0,"Ben Camper"
"we're working towards a pricing test in a market.","08:32","08:37",0,"Ben Camper"
"Again, when it's ready to be communicated, we can share it out, how we're going to do it, what the success metrics are, how long it's going to last, et cetera.","08:38","08:46",0,"Ben Camper"
"those are two other irons in the fire that we have in addition to the sales training.","08:47","08:51",0,"Ben Camper"
"I'm really hesitant to kind of expand beyond that.","08:51","08:57",0,"Ben Camper"
"I want to start checking the boxes.","08:57","08:59",0,"Ben Camper"
"Like, for example, if we decide through the feedback that the sales model we created is wrong, then we got to limit the other variables we have so that we can fix the sales model.","08:59","09:09",0,"Ben Camper"
"I'm not hearing that from the people that are closest to it.","09:09","09:12",0,"Ben Camper"
"we want to make sure that we control the variables.","09:12","09:15",0,"Ben Camper"
"Ultimately, we got to bump up conversion into the mid to high twenty s to hit the numbers that we need and we haven't had that since January.","09:15","09:26",0,"Ben Camper"
"Any questions there?","09:27","09:28",0,"Ben Camper"
"Just on, say, the business.","09:28","09:29",0,"Ben Camper"
"When I go through that, guys, is it helpful to understand or do you not need the reinforcement from the email that I shared earlier?","09:36","09:43",0,"Ben Camper"
"I find it helpful.","09:45","09:46",2,"Nigel Skiathitis"
"I think it's a good conversation for the group to have of kind of where we're performing and what we're focusing on and how we're evaluating it.","09:46","09:54",2,"Nigel Skiathitis"
"I think it's good this is the right group to be a part of that conversation and hear it from you.","09:54","10:00",2,"Nigel Skiathitis"
"Yeah, I like it too.","10:01","10:02",4,"Katy DiIorio"
"Just in case, I'm taking some notes because we're going to go into some of the problem solving towards the end.","10:02","10:06",4,"Katy DiIorio"
"it just helps to kind of refresh it in a picture.","10:07","10:10",4,"Katy DiIorio"
"Some other things on my mind, and this is, I think, probably just of a pivot from how we evolved the business as part of SCB.","10:15","10:27",0,"Ben Camper"
"If you think about, like, a year and a half ago, there was, like, a core base camp team.","10:27","10:32",0,"Ben Camper"
"there was a lot of shared services that were included in it.","10:32","10:36",0,"Ben Camper"
"because of that, probably the core base camp team was involved in most of the problem solving and understanding the business, and the core shared services were not.","10:36","10:46",0,"Ben Camper"
"I think, through this process, this same group has been on this call now for several months.","10:46","10:52",0,"Ben Camper"
"I know it's the right group.","10:53","10:54",0,"Ben Camper"
"I think we're developing more rhythm together ownership.","10:54","10:58",0,"Ben Camper"
"my intent is to have the whole group visibility to everything that is included in, say, the business.","10:58","11:08",0,"Ben Camper"
"an example of that is the Ops package.","11:08","11:09",0,"Ben Camper"
"I think before it was Nigel's, Miyu, John, Chuck, and Dave, alex and I were talking, and I'm like, we review the Ops pack.","11:09","11:22",0,"Ben Camper"
"We want everybody to be informed about the data in the Ops package.","11:22","11:25",0,"Ben Camper"
"But why aren't they on?","11:25","11:26",0,"Ben Camper"
"Why isn't this on the distro?","11:26","11:27",0,"Ben Camper"
"No idea why.","11:27","11:28",0,"Ben Camper"
"I have no idea how that original group got formed.","11:28","11:30",0,"Ben Camper"
"we'll make those adjustments so that everybody has everything that we're looking at that I'm looking at really, the whole group has.","11:31","11:39",0,"Ben Camper"
"So I think that's important to note.","11:39","11:41",0,"Ben Camper"
"that's April to date, two things I'd love to kind of get in everybody's head.","11:43","11:52",0,"Ben Camper"
"the first is we got a target this month to get to $62,000 in AUVs.","11:52","11:57",0,"Ben Camper"
"That's $3,000 more than today than what we're projecting today.","11:57","12:01",0,"Ben Camper"
"We got close out to get there.","12:02","12:04",0,"Ben Camper"
"62,000 is where we'd like to finish 28% conversion.","12:04","12:10",0,"Ben Camper"
"We're sitting at just under 20 right now, rounding up to 20.","12:11","12:14",0,"Ben Camper"
"Got to move that needle from 20 to 28.","12:14","12:17",0,"Ben Camper"
"We do that, we're going to win in April.","12:17","12:21",0,"Ben Camper"
"those are the two kind of two North Star net metrics there.","12:21","12:25",0,"Ben Camper"
"Nigel, can you give us a quick summary of the studios in Presale and how they're doing versus their founding member targets?","12:27","12:33",0,"Ben Camper"
"Absolutely.","12:34","12:35",2,"Nigel Skiathitis"
"So, quick update.","12:35","12:37",2,"Nigel Skiathitis"
"Ovido had their first billing today.","12:37","12:39",2,"Nigel Skiathitis"
"They're at about 88 members, 61 billed.","12:39","12:43",2,"Nigel Skiathitis"
"Ten are still pending, and they have 17 declines.","12:43","12:46",2,"Nigel Skiathitis"
"No news is good news on this one.","12:48","12:50",2,"Nigel Skiathitis"
"I haven't heard any issues from a technology standpoint.","12:50","12:54",2,"Nigel Skiathitis"
"They've been selling a bunch of memberships, but they've also that the pending number doesn't surprise me at all because they've been selling kind of a week trial and having membership start after that.","12:56","13:07",2,"Nigel Skiathitis"
"I'm assuming they'll continue to have kind of some pending memberships, continue to build up as they utilize that strategy.","13:07","13:15",2,"Nigel Skiathitis"
"Apple Valley sitting at about 170 plus they're getting ready to start actually processing them in the system.","13:16","13:23",2,"Nigel Skiathitis"
"I provided them information last week just around using DocuSign versus not using DocuSign.","13:23","13:31",2,"Nigel Skiathitis"
"they're getting ready there because they're comfortable with their opening date.","13:31","13:34",2,"Nigel Skiathitis"
"They are on pace to hit our target of 250.","13:34","13:39",2,"Nigel Skiathitis"
"they're in a really good spot converting over 30%.","13:39","13:43",2,"Nigel Skiathitis"
"really good to see that team continuing to build.","13:43","13:46",2,"Nigel Skiathitis"
"Their sign is actually supposed to be going up this week and they're hoping that builds some excitement and awareness for their studio in that market.","13:46","13:55",2,"Nigel Skiathitis"
"I know the real estate team is very bullish on that market in that location.","13:55","14:00",2,"Nigel Skiathitis"
"We got Overland Park.","14:00","14:02",2,"Nigel Skiathitis"
"Just a quick update for this group.","14:02","14:04",2,"Nigel Skiathitis"
"Ben did a lot of work and we had some conversations with Carrie and the development team and Overland Park is going to be getting on board with our acceleration program.","14:05","14:15",2,"Nigel Skiathitis"
"Had a conversation with Christy Cook on Friday and she was really excited.","14:15","14:21",2,"Nigel Skiathitis"
"She actually said, I didn't want to be a squeaky wheel and I had heard about it.","14:21","14:25",2,"Nigel Skiathitis"
"Just really excited.","14:26","14:28",2,"Nigel Skiathitis"
"Carrie's already engaged Asher in that work.","14:28","14:31",2,"Nigel Skiathitis"
"Legal should be sending them the amendment today.","14:31","14:34",2,"Nigel Skiathitis"
"Reached out to Susan last week there.","14:34","14:36",2,"Nigel Skiathitis"
"really excited to pour gas on that fire.","14:36","14:39",2,"Nigel Skiathitis"
"It's obviously an extremely talented team that we're going to get revving up.","14:40","14:44",2,"Nigel Skiathitis"
"They've had a slower start, but they're actually penciling them their start of presale about a week ago.","14:44","14:49",2,"Nigel Skiathitis"
"they're sitting at one founding member right now.","14:49","14:52",2,"Nigel Skiathitis"
"Christie has a really clear plan over the next few weeks to start to build that momentum and her paid social just started and now we're going to get to pour that acceleration dollars onto that fire.","14:52","15:04",2,"Nigel Skiathitis"
"really excited for what's to come over the next couple of weeks there.","15:04","15:07",2,"Nigel Skiathitis"
"Ensenitas is over 100 members, so they're really tracking well at this point.","15:08","15:13",2,"Nigel Skiathitis"
"They are on pace to clear that 250 mark as well.","15:13","15:16",2,"Nigel Skiathitis"
"They're still about 45 plus days out.","15:16","15:19",2,"Nigel Skiathitis"
"We know that momentum continues to build as you get closer to opening date with founding membership.","15:20","15:25",2,"Nigel Skiathitis"
"So they're sitting at 104.","15:25","15:27",2,"Nigel Skiathitis"
"We're even looking out sending a team member from Santa Monica down there to help if they get like a big day of events and pop up schedule.","15:28","15:37",2,"Nigel Skiathitis"
"But where is this Antonitis?","15:37","15:40",2,"Nigel Skiathitis"
"Didn't we already send a team member from Santa Monica down there?","15:40","15:42",0,"Ben Camper"
"No.","15:42","15:43",2,"Nigel Skiathitis"
"Oh yeah, fair enough.","15:43","15:46",2,"Nigel Skiathitis"
"their fitness manager is Kenny, who is a longtime coach for us in Santa Monica who we're seeing.","15:46","15:52",2,"Nigel Skiathitis"
"I mean, they ran a pop up yesterday and they converted six memberships off of that pop up yesterday.","15:52","15:59",2,"Nigel Skiathitis"
"we're seeing the impact of having someone that knows the base camp experience that was already a high level coach for us being able to go and bring that to life.","15:59","16:09",2,"Nigel Skiathitis"
"So some good progress there.","16:09","16:10",2,"Nigel Skiathitis"
"Fruit Cove still sitting at 65, not on pace.","16:11","16:16",2,"Nigel Skiathitis"
"They're struggling with staff and they're still operating without a studio manager.","16:17","16:20",2,"Nigel Skiathitis"
"They have a fitness manager now in place who Jesse is in the process of onboarding.","16:20","16:25",2,"Nigel Skiathitis"
"We like her.","16:25","16:26",2,"Nigel Skiathitis"
"She has really good large group training experience.","16:26","16:29",2,"Nigel Skiathitis"
"As Jesse would say.","16:29","16:30",2,"Nigel Skiathitis"
"Josh is plugging and filling the gaps as best as he can right now as a studio manager for that.","16:30","16:39",2,"Nigel Skiathitis"
"But they are not on pace.","16:39","16:42",2,"Nigel Skiathitis"
"honestly, week over week, they're not trending great.","16:42","16:46",2,"Nigel Skiathitis"
"I think they sold four memberships last week total.","16:46","16:48",2,"Nigel Skiathitis"
"there's still some work to do in that studio.","16:49","16:52",2,"Nigel Skiathitis"
"it starts with the work that they have to do with staffing, and that is a recap of presale right now.","16:52","16:59",2,"Nigel Skiathitis"
"Nigel, nice job.","17:03","17:04",0,"Ben Camper"
"I have a question as well.","17:04","17:07",0,"Ben Camper"
"I noticed for Troy, their upcoming projection got wiped out.","17:07","17:16",0,"Ben Camper"
"Did you catch that at all?","17:17","17:18",0,"Ben Camper"
"It's like completely at zero.","17:22","17:24",2,"Nigel Skiathitis"
"Well, last week they had $4,100 in actual and $5,200 in upcoming.","17:24","17:36",0,"Ben Camper"
"This week they have $4,800 in actual and $500 in upcoming.","17:36","17:42",0,"Ben Camper"
"They lost like $5,000.","17:42","17:44",0,"Ben Camper"
"Any idea why?","17:46","17:48",2,"Nigel Skiathitis"
"Go ahead.","17:51","17:52",2,"Nigel Skiathitis"
"Okay.","17:52","17:52",0,"Ben Camper"
"We did see a lot of those, a lot of attrition already.","17:53","17:57",5,"Alex Breunig"
"They had like 20% attrition when were going through the Ops package.","17:57","18:02",5,"Alex Breunig"
"It could be related to that.","18:03","18:05",5,"Alex Breunig"
"Some presales who canceled before open.","18:05","18:09",5,"Alex Breunig"
"Yeah.","18:12","18:12",2,"Nigel Skiathitis"
"if you look at Troy right now, let's see, they billed 42 people.","18:12","18:19",2,"Nigel Skiathitis"
"that is where the five grand is coming from in revenue.","18:19","18:23",2,"Nigel Skiathitis"
"And then they still have 21 pending.","18:23","18:27",2,"Nigel Skiathitis"
"So they've been selling memberships.","18:27","18:29",2,"Nigel Skiathitis"
"Actually, I had an hour long conversation with Deanna this morning.","18:29","18:32",2,"Nigel Skiathitis"
"They're actually starting to convert people at a pretty good pace.","18:32","18:35",2,"Nigel Skiathitis"
"I think that it speaks to the quality of coaches they have out there and the work that Jesse did with them.","18:35","18:41",2,"Nigel Skiathitis"
"Deanna and Valor taking a majority of those opportunities to convert.","18:42","18:46",2,"Nigel Skiathitis"
"They also have four declines.","18:46","18:49",2,"Nigel Skiathitis"
"So, I mean, like, in total, you're looking at a membership base right around 70.","18:49","18:52",2,"Nigel Skiathitis"
"Her goal is to get it to 90.","18:52","18:54",2,"Nigel Skiathitis"
"Ben, to your point, I think something seems off because 21 memberships for $520 in upcoming billing seems off.","18:54","19:05",2,"Nigel Skiathitis"
"the only thing I can think is maybe some of those people are falling outside of the end of the month for their first billing cycle.","19:05","19:12",2,"Nigel Skiathitis"
"But that number still feels really low.","19:13","19:14",2,"Nigel Skiathitis"
"If I'm just taking $120 average, which looks like that first group that paid is on, you'd say that would be at least two to three grand.","19:14","19:25",2,"Nigel Skiathitis"
"Do you remember when like, on day one, how many people they had either active pending?","19:25","19:30",0,"Ben Camper"
"Yeah, they were sitting right around 86.","19:31","19:34",2,"Nigel Skiathitis"
"87.","19:34","19:35",2,"Nigel Skiathitis"
"Let's give it a week or so and just see then how many go active.","19:36","19:39",0,"Ben Camper"
"I know sometimes in reporting for the founding members in the two week trial, I remember Dan Brusky, one point was explaining this, I send you the two screenshots.","19:41","19:55",0,"Ben Camper"
"Ironically, I had them, and so they're literally, week over week, you can see the drop, but let's keep an eye on it, maybe as the things normalized.","19:55","20:04",0,"Ben Camper"
"It is what it is.","20:04","20:05",0,"Ben Camper"
"Yeah, she has an eye on staffing and a pretty aggressive plan for outreach and lead generation.","20:09","20:16",2,"Nigel Skiathitis"
"again, I think if she can continue to went through her schedule today, and they're going to be sending me an updated studio plan today that they'll be going through with their team.","20:16","20:27",2,"Nigel Skiathitis"
"She did update her pro forma, or she still has some work to do.","20:28","20:32",2,"Nigel Skiathitis"
"Just she's updating.","20:32","20:32",2,"Nigel Skiathitis"
"where her starting point is for active members is kind of the one piece she's in there.","20:32","20:38",2,"Nigel Skiathitis"
"a positive note from a construction standpoint is I think their cost per square foot before Ti was around $60 a square foot, and post Ti, it brings it down to right around 50.","20:38","20:53",2,"Nigel Skiathitis"
"from a build out perspective, she definitely found a bunch of savings in doing a conversion of a preexisting studio there.","20:54","21:02",2,"Nigel Skiathitis"
"If she can grow fast and mitigate cancellations, she could get back on track to a break even by month six, which is what we coach, too.","21:07","21:15",2,"Nigel Skiathitis"
"So not all is lost.","21:15","21:17",2,"Nigel Skiathitis"
"It was not the presale we wanted, nor the start that we wanted, but if she can continue to convert at how she's converting right now, I think they can catch up and be on track come month six.","21:17","21:29",2,"Nigel Skiathitis"
"Cool.","21:30","21:31",2,"Nigel Skiathitis"
"Let's dive into department updates now.","21:35","21:36",0,"Ben Camper"
"Do you want to just keep rolling and then kick it to whoever's next?","21:36","21:39",0,"Ben Camper"
"Yeah, let's do it.","21:39","21:42",2,"Nigel Skiathitis"
"Let's see here.","21:43","21:44",2,"Nigel Skiathitis"
"Ben alluded to a few of these looking to do kind of a one pager for this group on our paid trial test, just to loop everybody in and then doing some work around our pricing test.","21:44","21:58",2,"Nigel Skiathitis"
"Think like sales pitch, sales deck, and some SOPs around how those team members can protect some of the surrounding studios.","21:58","22:09",2,"Nigel Skiathitis"
"Mary and I doing some launch training work today around continuing to evolve our launch training and add in some of the notes and some of the things that she's been working on there.","22:09","22:19",2,"Nigel Skiathitis"
"that work has been going really well.","22:19","22:21",2,"Nigel Skiathitis"
"I think her and Carly have built out by far the best launch training and onboarding we as a brand have ever had.","22:22","22:31",2,"Nigel Skiathitis"
"So kudos to her and Carly there.","22:31","22:34",2,"Nigel Skiathitis"
"I'm also going to be rolling out now that Kansas City is on the acceleration program, building out a weekly presale call versus individual calls.","22:34","22:42",2,"Nigel Skiathitis"
"It'll just be one presale call for all studios in Presale.","22:42","22:47",2,"Nigel Skiathitis"
"I think this will allow for some more best practices, being able to be shared, some peer to peer accountability around performance, and some time savings in there for me.","22:47","22:59",2,"Nigel Skiathitis"
"I think it's kind of a winner across the board.","22:59","23:01",2,"Nigel Skiathitis"
"I even floated the idea to a few of the studios in Presale and a few of our owners, and they seemed really excited about it.","23:01","23:07",2,"Nigel Skiathitis"
"So that's cool.","23:07","23:08",2,"Nigel Skiathitis"
"Doing a little work on some JDS around an FBC new studio opener.","23:08","23:13",2,"Nigel Skiathitis"
"We're getting ready to get New Jersey Presale on the books.","23:15","23:18",2,"Nigel Skiathitis"
"just finalizing that with Mary and that ownership group and we have some other things going on.","23:18","23:24",2,"Nigel Skiathitis"
"I'm still pumping out scripts.","23:24","23:26",2,"Nigel Skiathitis"
"Carrie, if I owe you anything, there let me know.","23:27","23:29",2,"Nigel Skiathitis"
"I sent you a bunch over the weekend and those are the big ones.","23:29","23:34",2,"Nigel Skiathitis"
"We've got 2023 goals, and I know we're going to be going through some work around tech pain points in our new studio opening process.","23:34","23:42",2,"Nigel Skiathitis"
"we have our Brand Marketing center launch this week, which Carrie will own.","23:43","23:48",2,"Nigel Skiathitis"
"So that's exciting.","23:48","23:49",2,"Nigel Skiathitis"
"Carrie, I can't edit who the person running the call is, but let me know when you want me to jump on there.","23:49","23:56",2,"Nigel Skiathitis"
"I'll just jump on early and make sure you're in all own letting people in as you go through the call so you don't have to worry about that.","23:56","24:06",2,"Nigel Skiathitis"
"I will pass it over just because he's right below me.","24:09","24:12",2,"Nigel Skiathitis"
"Jesse Jones.","24:12","24:14",2,"Nigel Skiathitis"
"Cool.","24:17","24:17",2,"Nigel Skiathitis"
"we had a coach's course last week, had 15 people in the coaches course, which is the largest coaches course that I've had to date.","24:19","24:26",3,"Jesse Jones"
"I auditioned six people on Friday and have another six people to audition between Monday, Tuesday and today, tomorrow and Wednesday.","24:26","24:38",3,"Jesse Jones"
"So a lot of good coaches.","24:39","24:41",3,"Jesse Jones"
"Columbia, I think, is shifting away from, I believe it's Whitney, who is their fitness manager, and they're onboarding three really good coaches.","24:41","24:50",3,"Jesse Jones"
"Some are relocating from Minneapolis to Columbia.","24:50","24:54",3,"Jesse Jones"
"So good stuff happening there.","24:54","24:56",3,"Jesse Jones"
"I auditioned two coaches.","24:57","25:01",3,"Jesse Jones"
"One was a studio manager and fitness manager for Australia, so that was really promising.","25:01","25:07",3,"Jesse Jones"
"I was weary of the fitness manager, but he actually came out of his show and he sounded really good.","25:08","25:12",3,"Jesse Jones"
"So Katie excited for him.","25:12","25:15",3,"Jesse Jones"
"We got to get him more exposed to base camp, but I certainly had a knee jerk reaction early on in my first few interactions with them.","25:15","25:23",3,"Jesse Jones"
"Mary and I are making some structural changes to way that we onboard coaches and fitness managers.","25:25","25:30",3,"Jesse Jones"
"For me personally, having different presales going on and then getting pushed back with construction and speeding up and hiring and firing of fitness managers, there were times where I didn't know what was going on.","25:31","25:44",3,"Jesse Jones"
"Mary's done a really good job helping design the academy and the dashboard, setting up time with me.","25:44","25:51",3,"Jesse Jones"
"So we're still optimizing that.","25:51","25:53",3,"Jesse Jones"
"some good changes this week on that.","25:53","25:56",3,"Jesse Jones"
"Got launch trainings that I'm preparing for.","25:57","25:59",3,"Jesse Jones"
"next week and the week after, I'll be on the road to Fruit Cove, Florida, and the Twin Cities.","25:59","26:10",3,"Jesse Jones"
"The week after, some of you on this call will be on the Summer Challenge kickoff, I believe it's tomorrow afternoon.","26:10","26:18",3,"Jesse Jones"
"excited to kick off that work already.","26:18","26:21",3,"Jesse Jones"
"I'll between this week and next week evaluating ten of the top coaches.","26:23","26:29",3,"Jesse Jones"
"That's a combination of fitness managers and coaches in the system to pressure test a new evaluation guide system that we are exploring that'll make it a lot more objective with our evaluation guides and less subjective.","26:29","26:44",3,"Jesse Jones"
"all things coaches and fitness manager development.","26:44","26:54",3,"Jesse Jones"
"Matt.","26:57","26:58",2,"Nigel Skiathitis"
"Matt great.","26:59","27:00",2,"Nigel Skiathitis"
"It's going to you.","27:00","27:01",2,"Nigel Skiathitis"
"I actually had one ask just in conversation with Troy today.","27:01","27:07",2,"Nigel Skiathitis"
"It sounds like that there's still some issues around consistencies with members being able to check in on the app.","27:07","27:14",2,"Nigel Skiathitis"
"Have you discovered anything around root cause there?","27:14","27:17",2,"Nigel Skiathitis"
"Are we worried about it being widespread and maybe just not hearing about it?","27:17","27:21",2,"Nigel Skiathitis"
"I guess that was kind of my one ask in there.","27:21","27:26",2,"Nigel Skiathitis"
"You're on mute.","27:31","27:32",2,"Nigel Skiathitis"
"The two studios that were aware of issues were two of the studios that there was a particular configuration in Marianitech that was not set specifically.","27:35","27:52",1,"Matt Khoury"
"There was a default check in time that had a null value, an empty value.","27:52","27:57",1,"Matt Khoury"
"because of that, Sylvia and I took a deeper dive into the apps logs and we saw that studios that have a considerably higher check in error rate happened to be the studios that didn't have that value set.","27:59","28:24",1,"Matt Khoury"
"Ian had that value set and we can see the graph of errors that happened.","28:25","28:32",1,"Matt Khoury"
"Some errors, it's just normal, but it just dropped off a cliff.","28:33","28:40",1,"Matt Khoury"
"There's far fewer errors happening consistent with the rest of the system.","28:41","28:47",1,"Matt Khoury"
"I e normal.","28:47","28:49",1,"Matt Khoury"
"So, no, I'm not aware of anything special for that particular studio.","28:49","28:56",1,"Matt Khoury"
"If there were check in issues that were widespread, they would be happening everywhere now.","28:57","29:04",1,"Matt Khoury"
"Because as far as we can tell, marian attack is now set up consistently across the US domestic system.","29:05","29:18",1,"Matt Khoury"
"if we need to get on a phone call, I'm happy to do that.","29:19","29:26",1,"Matt Khoury"
"yeah, the last thing I heard, Nigel, when this was like two weeks ago, after I told Josh that we'd made some changes, this was in Kahaba.","29:28","29:39",1,"Matt Khoury"
"I think he said he'd monitor and get back to me if there are any issues.","29:39","29:43",1,"Matt Khoury"
"I haven't heard anything.","29:43","29:45",1,"Matt Khoury"
"So, yeah, if there are more issues, I need to know.","29:46","29:52",1,"Matt Khoury"
"Let's get a meeting call on the books.","29:52","29:55",1,"Matt Khoury"
"But I'm not aware of anything.","29:56","29:58",1,"Matt Khoury"
"The one I asked, the ask I had of Tiana in that was to be able to provide examples like member X booked a class and was there 15 minutes beforehand and was not being given the option to check in.","29:59","30:15",2,"Nigel Skiathitis"
"That would be great.","30:15","30:16",1,"Matt Khoury"
"Now, it's not to say that there can't be these one offs.","30:16","30:20",1,"Matt Khoury"
"For example, I'm talking with somebody.","30:20","30:22",1,"Matt Khoury"
"I'm probably going to go meet this member of Woodbury that her schedule just doesn't appear fully in her app.","30:22","30:29",1,"Matt Khoury"
"when we sign in as her, our apps look normal.","30:30","30:35",1,"Matt Khoury"
"You have an iPhone 14 Pro?","30:35","30:37",1,"Matt Khoury"
"I have an iPhone 14 Pro.","30:37","30:38",1,"Matt Khoury"
"I don't understand why yours does that and mine does.","30:38","30:41",1,"Matt Khoury"
"it is weird anomalies that could happen, but I do not believe there to be anything widespread or else we'd be hearing more of it, especially from you guys.","30:41","30:53",1,"Matt Khoury"
"Oh, are you handing it to me?","31:01","31:03",1,"Matt Khoury"
"Yeah.","31:03","31:04",0,"Ben Camper"
"Well, I want to do the product update now.","31:05","31:07",1,"Matt Khoury"
"Can I do that?","31:07","31:08",1,"Matt Khoury"
"I'm going to pass it off to Carrie.","31:10","31:13",1,"Matt Khoury"
"Cool.","31:15","31:15",4,"Katy DiIorio"
"Thank you.","31:15","31:16",6,"Carrie Konosky"
"So, Wednesday, that's the biggie for this week.","31:17","31:19",6,"Carrie Konosky"
"We have the all brand call 02:00 to 330 Central time.","31:19","31:23",6,"Carrie Konosky"
"If you are not on the invite and want to join, let Nigel or I know so we can forward it to you.","31:24","31:29",6,"Carrie Konosky"
"I think the first 45 minutes would be really valuable for this team.","31:29","31:33",6,"Carrie Konosky"
"If you can't join live, watch the recording.","31:33","31:35",6,"Carrie Konosky"
"Tracy and Beth from the creative perspective will be kind of explaining the strategy behind our brand refresh and I think it'll just be help, especially for those of you that speak to studio managers and our franchisee facing to get of the understanding behind that.","31:35","31:51",6,"Carrie Konosky"
"the CRM project I think I updated last week.","31:52","31:58",6,"Carrie Konosky"
"We did accept the proposal from Bold Orange.","31:58","32:00",6,"Carrie Konosky"
"So we're waiting on the final timeline.","32:00","32:01",6,"Carrie Konosky"
"Nigel got your script, so I will let you know if there's anything else I need.","32:01","32:05",6,"Carrie Konosky"
"thank you for getting that in from a paid media side.","32:05","32:09",6,"Carrie Konosky"
"Kind of to jump onto some of the updates to our Ramp studios.","32:09","32:12",6,"Carrie Konosky"
"We are seeing some really good numbers.","32:12","32:15",6,"Carrie Konosky"
"I think the performance with our preferred agency Asher has been improving a lot, especially this last month to six weeks.","32:15","32:22",6,"Carrie Konosky"
"Apple Valley is by far now our top studio in terms of presell and how they are doing with paid media.","32:23","32:29",6,"Carrie Konosky"
"We're seeing really good numbers from Ensenitas and as Nigel said, we have Overland Park about to kick off.","32:29","32:36",6,"Carrie Konosky"
"Spoke with Asher just before this and they're putting together a proposal now that we have those acceleration dollars.","32:36","32:42",6,"Carrie Konosky"
"Ben will probably talk about that with them this week on our call.","32:42","32:45",6,"Carrie Konosky"
"really just excited to see the work that's happening there.","32:45","32:49",6,"Carrie Konosky"
"The other biggie from the marketing side is if you haven't heard, we did hire our new social media manager dedicated to base camp.","32:49","32:56",6,"Carrie Konosky"
"His name is Kevin Liu.","32:56","32:58",6,"Carrie Konosky"
"His Instagram handle is Sweat Engine if you want to follow him.","32:58","33:02",6,"Carrie Konosky"
"The guy has a crazy he's a stud.","33:02","33:05",6,"Carrie Konosky"

"Yeah, he's awesome.","33:10","33:10",6,"Carrie Konosky"
"He's based out in the San Francisco area.","33:11","33:13",6,"Carrie Konosky"

"big win for us to have him on the team.","33:14","33:17",6,"Carrie Konosky"
"summer challenge, I know we have the kickoff.","33:17","33:21",6,"Carrie Konosky"
"The creative team has started work on that.","33:22","33:23",6,"Carrie Konosky"
"I got the first preview of the lockup and some of the design work.","33:23","33:27",6,"Carrie Konosky"
"It looks really cool.","33:27","33:28",6,"Carrie Konosky"
"They're kind of playing with our colors in a way that we haven't yet with this new branding.","33:28","33:32",6,"Carrie Konosky"
"excited to be able to share that with you guys soon.","33:32","33:35",6,"Carrie Konosky"
"I will send it to Ashley.","33:36","33:37",6,"Carrie Konosky"

"The work you've done with Asher and Paid Media has been awesome to see.","34:46","34:51",0,"Ben Camper"
"You spoke about some of the results, but that's like a byproduct of just some of the management you've had guiding them and steering them on things that we're hearing from franchisees.","34:51","35:01",0,"Ben Camper"
"It hasn't been a smooth journey.","35:01","35:03",0,"Ben Camper"
"We still have room to go.","35:03","35:05",0,"Ben Camper"
"We're improving our communication.","35:05","35:07",0,"Ben Camper"

"All good.","35:35","35:36",7,"Ashley Siede"
"Good job, Carrie.","35:36","35:37",7,"Ashley Siede"
"Okay, let's see here.","35:39","35:41",7,"Ashley Siede"
"This week, Mindy and I are kind of doing a big overhaul analysis of all of our base camp inventory.","35:41","35:49",7,"Ashley Siede"
"In our warehouse, we have a forecasting tool that was built for us now so we can really be following along with the sales.","35:50","35:58",7,"Ashley Siede"
"What do we still have on hand?","35:58","36:00",7,"Ashley Siede"
"It'll tell us what do we need to buy, how many months of supply do we have?","36:03","36:07",7,"Ashley Siede"
"This will be awesome for our mileage shirts because I know we have struggled with keeping them in stock.","36:07","36:12",7,"Ashley Siede"
"the warehouse is doing a huge inventory count today with everything big shipment that's come in.","36:12","36:17",7,"Ashley Siede"
"a big win there once we get that whole piece going.","36:17","36:22",7,"Ashley Siede"
"just compiling all the product knowledge info for the summer releases and then after the summer challenge call, I will work on sourcing some ideas for.","36:23","36:37",7,"Ashley Siede"
"The Swag product for that.","36:38","36:40",8,"Mary Vicario"
"Those are kind of my biggies oh, I'm sorry.","36:42","36:48",7,"Ashley Siede"
"I need to hand it off to somebody.","36:48","36:49",7,"Ashley Siede"
"Alex.","36:50","36:51",8,"Mary Vicario"
"Thanks.","36:53","36:54",5,"Alex Breunig"
"Let's see.","36:54","36:55",5,"Alex Breunig"
"So quarter close.","36:55","36:57",5,"Alex Breunig"
"That should be wrapping up.","36:57","36:58",5,"Alex Breunig"
"Accounting getting it closed either today or tomorrow.","36:58","37:01",5,"Alex Breunig"
"variance analysis on our PNL income statement should be going throughout the rest of this week.","37:01","37:08",5,"Alex Breunig"
"All of you should be getting the Ops package from me later this week.","37:09","37:14",5,"Alex Breunig"
"Where then?","37:14","37:15",5,"Alex Breunig"
"We'll review it on this call next week.","37:15","37:18",5,"Alex Breunig"
"Tuesday.","37:18","37:18",0,"Ben Camper"
"I think it's happening on Tuesday instead.","37:18","37:21",5,"Alex Breunig"
"doing a lot of analysis around that and then working with Nigel on that pre open ramp numbers the pre open studio sales for those members against our targets.","37:22","37:38",5,"Alex Breunig"
"working on some improvements to our current Ops package, reporting just quality of life and improving how we frame the information that we present.","37:38","37:51",5,"Alex Breunig"
"Who hasn't gone.","37:54","37:55",5,"Alex Breunig"
"Mary?","37:55","37:56",5,"Alex Breunig"
"Thanks Alex, I appreciate it.","37:58","38:00",8,"Mary Vicario"
"Lots of stuff going on related to team member onboarding and just shoring up those processes, digitizing it, leveraging the tools and resources so that Jesse and Nigel don't need to push that train down the track and putting responsibility back in the learners on learners plate.","38:00","38:19",8,"Mary Vicario"
"also creating content so that the franchisee can really drive the onboarding of their team members.","38:20","38:25",8,"Mary Vicario"
"Studio teams can manage the onboarding of their team members.","38:26","38:29",8,"Mary Vicario"
"Medallion is in full swing, so it's taking up a considerable amount of my time trying to get the emails written.","38:29","38:36",8,"Mary Vicario"
"Nigel, thank you for your time last week.","38:36","38:37",8,"Mary Vicario"
"Kind of going over how we're going to operationalize the timing and SLAs for studios.","38:38","38:44",8,"Mary Vicario"
"Exciting to see that come together.","38:44","38:46",8,"Mary Vicario"
"Summer challenge.","38:46","38:48",8,"Mary Vicario"
"Carrie is super excited to get the Brand Marketing Center up and going.","38:48","38:51",8,"Mary Vicario"
"All the content has been developed and ready for that and then we've got some the staffing toolkit then will be released probably by the end of this week.","38:51","39:00",8,"Mary Vicario"
"It looks really good.","39:00","39:02",8,"Mary Vicario"
"Super happy with where we've landed on a lot of the content.","39:02","39:05",8,"Mary Vicario"
"I think it'll be helpful for the studios to have access to all those resources.","39:05","39:09",8,"Mary Vicario"
"I think that those are the big nuggets.","39:10","39:12",8,"Mary Vicario"
"If there's other things, they're obviously not front of mind.","39:12","39:16",8,"Mary Vicario"
"if I miss something I'm supposed to be working on for you, let me know.","39:16","39:19",8,"Mary Vicario"
"that's on my plate today or this week.","39:20","39:23",8,"Mary Vicario"
"Katie, off to you.","39:23","39:27",8,"Mary Vicario"
"Thanks Mary.","39:27","39:28",4,"Katy DiIorio"
"Super excited to give a little update on Summit here.","39:28","39:35",4,"Katy DiIorio"
"currently they are on track to hit their close out, their mini close out of tier one which will end on May 14.","39:35","39:43",4,"Katy DiIorio"
"They've got over 300 actual leads out of a goal of 570.","39:43","39:49",4,"Katy DiIorio"
"They have now sold twelve presale memberships out of the 21 for the mini close out with a goal of ultimately getting 110 by the time the studio actually opened.","39:49","40:05",4,"Katy DiIorio"
"The news is there might be some additional delays.","40:05","40:09",4,"Katy DiIorio"
"We'll find out more tonight.","40:09","40:11",4,"Katy DiIorio"
"In terms of opening the studio, it's not a shocker, these things happen all the time, but Texas is going to have me for longer before I head back out to Australia.","40:11","40:20",4,"Katy DiIorio"
"So that's the big one.","40:20","40:22",4,"Katy DiIorio"
"The next one is Class pass.","40:22","40:24",4,"Katy DiIorio"
"just trying to get all of our corporate locations more consistent in terms of what they're presenting, making sure that we're optimizing all that class pass has to offer and seeing if we can engage more of our class pass consumers, bring in some extra dollars, and possibly convert long term.","40:24","40:43",4,"Katy DiIorio"
"those are the two big things with the exciting news.","40:43","40:48",4,"Katy DiIorio"
"I get to go out to Fruit Cove and hang and experience the launch training out there.","40:48","40:53",4,"Katy DiIorio"
"I'll head out with the team and get to hear all about this launch training that's been building out.","40:53","40:58",4,"Katy DiIorio"
"really excited for that piece as well, too.","40:58","41:01",4,"Katy DiIorio"
"Other than that, I've just been, like I said, trying to solidify some of the processes and learnings that we've taken so far with Summit and some of that stuff is just kind of already in.","41:01","41:10",4,"Katy DiIorio"
"Works naturally because we've come up against some challenges.","41:10","41:13",4,"Katy DiIorio"
"I'm the last one to go.","41:15","41:16",4,"Katy DiIorio"
"Yeah.","41:17","41:17",4,"Katy DiIorio"
"Katie, I haven't asked for you that while you were talking, it occurred to me.","41:18","41:21",8,"Mary Vicario"
"So talk to Libby.","41:21","41:23",8,"Mary Vicario"
"we want to prioritize getting the master dashboard set up, and with the delays with Australia, it might be a good time for you to get your hands in there.","41:23","41:34",8,"Mary Vicario"
"I'd love to schedule some time, maybe while we're out in Fruit Cove, to just sit down and talk about what that will look like.","41:34","41:40",8,"Mary Vicario"
"I'll start inviting you to those calls with Lucas that you're part of the stand up process for that.","41:41","41:45",8,"Mary Vicario"
"Okay, yeah, that would be awesome.","41:46","41:48",4,"Katy DiIorio"
"It is on my list, and I've been just kind of reviewing what's currently on the base camp dashboard, like you and I had talked about, I don't know, ages and ages ago, but that would be super helpful.","41:48","41:57",4,"Katy DiIorio"
"Thank you.","41:59","42:00",8,"Mary Vicario"
"I feel like there was something I was going to ask this team, but I forgot.","42:01","42:06",4,"Katy DiIorio"
"So, Ben, back to you.","42:06","42:07",4,"Katy DiIorio"
"Take it to Matt.","42:08","42:10",0,"Ben Camper"
"Matt, there's just a saying right now.","42:31","42:33",0,"Ben Camper"
"It's silence is golden.","42:33","42:35",0,"Ben Camper"
"Sorry.","42:35","42:36",1,"Matt Khoury"
"Somebody tell the tech guy how to unmute $2,000.","42:39","42:44",0,"Ben Camper"
"MacBook it's a little more than that, by the way, but come on.","42:44","42:48",1,"Matt Khoury"
"Boomer.","42:48","42:49",2,"Nigel Skiathitis"
"I've been thinking about this particular segment of this meeting for a little while now.","42:51","42:55",1,"Matt Khoury"
"Specifically, I've been feeling it's been rough, and in the interest of just trying to dial in the signal so that it's a really good use for all of your time.","42:56","43:17",1,"Matt Khoury"
"There's some changes that I've been kneeling on in this section here with Ben, and it's all around product intake, but also giving all of you guys enough time to digest some of these meteor topics before we actually talk about them instead of getting here on a beautiful Monday and then trying to drink from a fire hose near the end of most of your days.","43:20","43:50",1,"Matt Khoury"
"the way that we're going to evolve, hopefully improve here, this product intake process, and then again, how we present that stuff here, there's a slight change to it.","43:51","44:10",1,"Matt Khoury"
"The part where there isn't a change to it is the one page of that I think most of you have seen.","44:12","44:20",1,"Matt Khoury"
"If anything, I'm just encouraging people to fill that out, to not take more than ten or 15 minutes to do it.","44:20","44:28",1,"Matt Khoury"
"if you need help, you should work with me on it.","44:28","44:30",1,"Matt Khoury"
"Happy to do it.","44:30","44:31",1,"Matt Khoury"
"if you want to meet before you actually fill that out to talk it through, let's do that.","44:31","44:35",1,"Matt Khoury"
"Too many options.","44:35","44:38",1,"Matt Khoury"
"After we've got the one pager completed, for sure, let's get together and pressure some of the things that are in it, things that you've written.","44:39","44:49",1,"Matt Khoury"
"Maybe there are opportunities to plus it, think about it differently.","44:49","44:52",1,"Matt Khoury"
"And if it's good.","44:54","44:56",1,"Matt Khoury"
"This doesn't need to be more than a 15 or 30 minutes touch base, but then what I'll do and commit to doing weekly by Wednesday or Thursday is to just coalesce all of the one pagers that I think will have time to review on the following Monday and send them out to you guys.","44:56","45:16",1,"Matt Khoury"
"It should be a true one pager.","45:18","45:21",1,"Matt Khoury"
"my ask would be is that you just read that in preparation for this meeting, because if you submitted it, I'm going to ask you to present it at this meeting, talking through it for about 60 seconds and seeing that everybody else here will have already read it and you've set it up.","45:21","45:44",1,"Matt Khoury"
"Or if I wrote it, I've set it up, then we can have some deeper discussion and debate versus trying to wrap our heads around like two or three new things that just got presented right now, which is really hard to process again, especially later in some of your days.","45:44","46:04",1,"Matt Khoury"
"after several minutes of discussion and debate, and depending on how deep we go, basically I want to hand it over to Ben.","46:05","46:16",1,"Matt Khoury"
"at that point he could say, this is good to go.","46:16","46:23",1,"Matt Khoury"
"Thumbs up.","46:24","46:25",1,"Matt Khoury"
"What's the next step?","46:25","46:26",1,"Matt Khoury"
"What do you need?","46:26","46:27",1,"Matt Khoury"
"He could kill it, in which case it's the end of the line.","46:27","46:31",1,"Matt Khoury"
"Or he could say maybe, but more information is needed, go back to the drawing board, in which case we'll just do that research and discovery until the next meeting and then just surface it back up.","46:32","46:46",1,"Matt Khoury"
"My hope is that with this slight modification to this part of our meeting, it'll just feel a bit more streamlined and together versus, again, drinking from a fire hose.","46:48","47:01",1,"Matt Khoury"
"Any comments, questions, concerns?","47:02","47:05",1,"Matt Khoury"
"Even betters.","47:06","47:07",1,"Matt Khoury"
"I'll jump in and say like, I appreciate you laying this out.","47:09","47:13",2,"Nigel Skiathitis"
"I think it'll be really helpful as we there will be no lack of ideas and things that we want to work on.","47:13","47:19",2,"Nigel Skiathitis"
"I think you laying up this process creates a really simple followable format for us to start to have these conversations and execute things.","47:19","47:30",2,"Nigel Skiathitis"
"thanks for taking the time to build this out.","47:30","47:32",2,"Nigel Skiathitis"
"I know you put a good amount of work into it, so I appreciate it.","47:32","47:36",2,"Nigel Skiathitis"
"Thanks, Nigel.","47:37","47:37",1,"Matt Khoury"
"I appreciate the comments too.","47:37","47:39",1,"Matt Khoury"
"I'm here to try to make what can tend to be some complex technical issues, stuff easier and less intimidating.","47:39","47:53",1,"Matt Khoury"
"So I want to help with that.","47:55","47:56",1,"Matt Khoury"
"I'm happy to help with that.","47:56","47:57",1,"Matt Khoury"
"Happy to dig into this stuff.","47:58","48:00",1,"Matt Khoury"
"This is fun to me.","48:00","48:02",1,"Matt Khoury"
"So, yeah, looking forward to partnering with you guys on all the fun and interesting outcome driven things you want to do.","48:02","48:12",1,"Matt Khoury"
"That's it.","48:13","48:14",1,"Matt Khoury"
"No changes to the one page.","48:14","48:15",1,"Matt Khoury"
"Matt, I got one quick question.","48:19","48:21",8,"Mary Vicario"
"I see, if approved, Matt adds a placeholder on the roadmap.","48:21","48:26",8,"Mary Vicario"
"I know that's your roadmap.","48:26","48:28",8,"Mary Vicario"
"One of my asks is that we also look at Windows, particularly if there is any change management or development needed for the field.","48:28","48:35",8,"Mary Vicario"
"Look what I did so that we're looking at the field's capacity and GoPro.","48:36","48:42",8,"Mary Vicario"
"also, I think you had resources already and Windows kind of filters for that, too.","48:42","48:46",8,"Mary Vicario"
"Excellent call out.","48:47","48:49",1,"Matt Khoury"
"I am not intending to replace your Windows PowerPoint.","48:49","48:54",1,"Matt Khoury"
"I just wanted to bring it over here.","48:54","48:57",1,"Matt Khoury"
"we look at this roadmap together, when I share it with other people, we see it clearly laid out perfect for studio app stuff or things that I have a part of or Tech has a part of in the studio.","48:57","49:14",1,"Matt Khoury"
"I've created a lane for that.","49:15","49:16",1,"Matt Khoury"
"we can kind of see here on the predefined Windows where that lies.","49:16","49:21",1,"Matt Khoury"
"Same thing for Base Camp's website and apps, and the same thing for Summits website and apps and Sylvio from Fittive just so that we can get a clear view into how he is evolving.","49:22","49:39",1,"Matt Khoury"
"The Fittive app, which is Base Camp, is a white labeled version of that.","49:39","49:43",1,"Matt Khoury"
"He's going to lay out high level bricks here, if you will, what's on his roadmap for the year or however long out, far out he plans that stuff.","49:43","49:55",1,"Matt Khoury"
"I've also asked the vendor team to take what they know, ian knows about what he's hearing about Mariana Tech talking about when they're possibly delivering this thing or that thing.","49:55","50:12",1,"Matt Khoury"
"I think I heard Nigel and you and Mary say a couple of things that Mariana Tech is working on that well, okay, let's get it on here so we can actually see when it's expected and if there are any other areas where, it makes sense to consolidate our roadmap views.","50:12","50:31",1,"Matt Khoury"
"Like, this is an editable board by anybody that's got the link.","50:31","50:34",1,"Matt Khoury"
"I'm happy to share the link with you.","50:34","50:37",1,"Matt Khoury"
"I've got my stuff in here that I'm going to manage, and I want to know if there are competing things or things that could potentially conflict.","50:38","50:51",1,"Matt Khoury"
"That would be the whole purpose of having this type of view.","50:51","50:55",1,"Matt Khoury"
"minimally, it'd be great to just get all the tech stuff in this one place.","50:55","50:59",1,"Matt Khoury"
"Yeah, I think maybe we add in some of the Windows stuff.","51:01","51:05",8,"Mary Vicario"
"My concern is, as we're creating these One pagers and we're prioritizing them and we're making commitments to do the work, are we looking at what's already been mapped out as kind of the year continues.","51:05","51:20",8,"Mary Vicario"
"We're already compressed and the last couple of windows of the year, from a fuel perspective, they're GoPro.","51:20","51:26",8,"Mary Vicario"
"So it's just on my mind.","51:26","51:28",8,"Mary Vicario"
"I wonder if we can find a way to compare your roadmap to what's already plotted out for the year.","51:28","51:34",8,"Mary Vicario"
"that doesn't mean we don't pull something and replace it with what you're working on.","51:34","51:37",8,"Mary Vicario"
"I just think we need to talk about it.","51:37","51:40",8,"Mary Vicario"
"Cool.","51:41","51:41",1,"Matt Khoury"
"Noted.","51:42","51:42",0,"Ben Camper"
"Just to echo that too, Matt, and again, I appreciate you making this more digestible because it definitely sometimes is a lot to read through.","51:42","51:49",6,"Carrie Konosky"
"these calls are really helpful to kind of Mary's Point thinking through from my side from working with Creative and content for the web stuff.","51:49","51:58",6,"Carrie Konosky"
"I think that would be the other piece of just seeing what we have knowing.","51:59","52:02",6,"Carrie Konosky"
"Can our internal team do it?","52:02","52:04",6,"Carrie Konosky"
"Do we need to contract things out and then making sure we're taking time for the review process for anything that Creative would need to have eyes on?","52:04","52:13",6,"Carrie Konosky"
"Sure.","52:13","52:13",1,"Matt Khoury"
"Good calls.","52:14","52:15",1,"Matt Khoury"
"Yeah, absolutely.","52:16","52:17",1,"Matt Khoury"
"I would be mistaken if I didn't say, like, hey, whatever we do for Base Camp, can we consider any implications for Summit?","52:18","52:26",4,"Katy DiIorio"
"The international meaning?","52:26","52:30",4,"Katy DiIorio"
"If we're going to make changes, I know it's already thought of the example we're about to give, but like the website, for example, if you're considering both Base Camp and Summit or something like.","52:30","52:39",4,"Katy DiIorio"
"That.","52:39","52:40",6,"Carrie Konosky"
"That'S a great call out too.","52:43","52:45",1,"Matt Khoury"
"I want to say I will fight anybody on this call to the death to keep the two sites in sync and the two apps in sync.","52:45","53:01",1,"Matt Khoury"
"If they wanted to do anything different than that, it becomes a nightmare when that would be the goal.","53:02","53:09",1,"Matt Khoury"
"Let's just say that would be the goal.","53:09","53:11",1,"Matt Khoury"
"there'd have to be a very good reason for not doing what we do in one and the other.","53:11","53:16",1,"Matt Khoury"
"Got a mean gator roll.","53:17","53:19",2,"Nigel Skiathitis"
"I don't know if you want to fight him to the death.","53:19","53:21",2,"Nigel Skiathitis"
"Tap or snap, baby.","53:22","53:23",3,"Jesse Jones"
"Tap or snap.","53:23","53:24",3,"Jesse Jones"
"Okay, let me go back.","53:27","53:29",1,"Matt Khoury"
"Here my other updates that I wanted to I'm not going to go through any one pages today because this is a new thing and I'm going to do what I said and send them out beforehand.","53:29","53:38",1,"Matt Khoury"
"we're going to read them in next week.","53:38","53:40",1,"Matt Khoury"
"We'll go through them.","53:40","53:41",1,"Matt Khoury"
"my updates today are on the Experience lighting.","53:41","53:44",1,"Matt Khoury"
"Summit, this is going to be important for you guys.","53:44","53:46",1,"Matt Khoury"
"Katie, there's a certification path that the lighting system is on.","53:46","53:51",1,"Matt Khoury"
"It's going to take about six to eight weeks.","53:51","53:53",1,"Matt Khoury"
"There isn't a high degree of concern that it would take any longer than that.","53:54","53:58",1,"Matt Khoury"
"Certification is needed to streamline the implementation of stuff that you plug into an outlet.","53:58","54:05",1,"Matt Khoury"
"We talked about product intake, the studio app rollout.","54:07","54:11",1,"Matt Khoury"
"last week, I think we pretty much settled on a plan to roll it out.","54:11","54:18",1,"Matt Khoury"
"We're going to kick the tires in Edina on April 26, and or 27th, and then take a week to digest what we've learned.","54:18","54:30",1,"Matt Khoury"
"May 8 I think that's a Monday.","54:30","54:33",1,"Matt Khoury"
"The plan is to fully roll it out in Burling game, and we'll be on site for that, along with helping to document what needs documenting and train who needs training and so on and so forth.","54:34","54:50",1,"Matt Khoury"
"Assuming that goes well, because it will, then the plan is the following week to roll it out to the system.","54:51","54:59",1,"Matt Khoury"
"I think that was the.","54:59","55:02",1,"Matt Khoury"
"There'S still.","55:04","55:05",2,"Nigel Skiathitis"
"Some detail to be sorted there, but that's the plan.","55:05","55:09",1,"Matt Khoury"
"Mary, I don't know, I think I'd work with you on just help me help you or others prep.","55:09","55:17",1,"Matt Khoury"
"Whether that's communications or manuals, I assume that after the test in Edina, we'll have a clear indication whether we're going to do this on May 8 in Burlingame.","55:18","55:35",1,"Matt Khoury"
"Yeah, Matt, in Burlingame is where we'll build SOPs and manuals and all that stuff.","55:38","55:45",8,"Mary Vicario"
"Cool.","55:46","55:47",2,"Nigel Skiathitis"
"The Summit website is coming along, and because it's going to be the Base Camp website, I wanted to just share some of what it looks like with you.","55:48","55:59",1,"Matt Khoury"
"The back end infrastructure is being built still, but the front end of it is looking pretty decent.","56:00","56:10",1,"Matt Khoury"
"this is what Summits page looks like home page looks like.","56:12","56:15",1,"Matt Khoury"
"I'm just getting this back from the front end developer that I hired.","56:16","56:20",1,"Matt Khoury"
"We've got videos plan.","56:22","56:25",1,"Matt Khoury"
"We've got what the workout entails.","56:25","56:28",1,"Matt Khoury"
"We've got a promotion.","56:30","56:32",1,"Matt Khoury"
"We've got info about the app and a standard footer.","56:32","56:36",1,"Matt Khoury"
"And the studio pages are coming along.","56:36","56:39",1,"Matt Khoury"
"This is the coming soon studio page, which is basically a landing page.","56:40","56:44",1,"Matt Khoury"
"the opening soon landing page, it's slowly coming together.","56:44","56:50",1,"Matt Khoury"
"I'd say the home page is in a bit more polished state than these studio pages are because I literally just got these a couple of hours ago and wanted to just pop them up on the screen so you guys could see this is not functional.","56:50","57:03",1,"Matt Khoury"
"the code that makes this look like this does is it's in code.","57:03","57:09",1,"Matt Khoury"
"the engineer who's working on the content management system will basically deconstruct this into blocks and implement it and do course for Summit and likewise for Base Camp.","57:09","57:28",1,"Matt Khoury"
"Hey, Matt, the copy reading Carrie's necklace, awesome.","57:28","57:34",0,"Ben Camper"
"Agree with you and I carry.","57:34","57:36",0,"Ben Camper"
"I'm going to bridge the question and the work you and me and Angelina were talking about earlier.","57:36","57:42",0,"Ben Camper"
"Matt, the copy around what's the workout and all of that, who's creating that?","57:42","57:49",0,"Ben Camper"
"That was created by the guy that did the updated Summit brand book.","57:50","57:57",1,"Matt Khoury"
"Jenna could a genus team.","58:03","58:06",1,"Matt Khoury"
"Okay, so the reason I asked I don't have feedback.","58:08","58:12",0,"Ben Camper"
"I think, again, I'm getting excited about this.","58:13","58:16",0,"Ben Camper"
"It's visually it looks awesome.","58:16","58:18",0,"Ben Camper"
"Carrie and I were on a call with Angelina earlier today where we did the segmentation work to better understand who's the 70% of our consumers and how do they think and what type of messaging they may respond to.","58:20","58:35",0,"Ben Camper"
"it might be good not to change or transform anything, but just to make sure we have that to pass through some of this language.","58:35","58:45",0,"Ben Camper"
"some things that I noticed, Carrie, again, was like some of the rigidity of the language, right.","58:46","58:50",0,"Ben Camper"
"how that really is alienating to some of our groups.","58:50","58:52",0,"Ben Camper"
"the cool thing about all this, Matt, is I know you shared with me is super modular and so we can adapt and change and a B test and all that.","58:53","59:00",0,"Ben Camper"
"How cool would we care if we got to a place where based on who we thought the person landing on the site was for Active?","59:00","59:08",0,"Ben Camper"
"Was it active?","59:08","59:10",0,"Ben Camper"
"Wellness seeker versus strength trainer.","59:10","59:12",0,"Ben Camper"
"you might have photos of people doing more weights than, like, cardio.","59:13","59:16",0,"Ben Camper"
"that can be really cool to explore.","59:16","59:18",0,"Ben Camper"
"Right.","59:18","59:18",0,"Ben Camper"
"there are some cool segmentation work that we should certainly be aware of.","59:18","59:23",0,"Ben Camper"
"Yeah, I know that work was domestic in Canada.","59:23","59:27",6,"Carrie Konosky"
"that gives us of time to look from what we have here and take that back to the content team and say, what can we change and start testing?","59:27","59:34",6,"Carrie Konosky"
"Cool.","59:38","59:38",0,"Ben Camper"
"I love it, matt, you did such a great job.","59:38","59:41",6,"Carrie Konosky"
"Cool.","59:42","59:43",1,"Matt Khoury"
"I didn't build that, but I helped design it.","59:43","59:47",1,"Matt Khoury"
"Appreciate the comment, though.","59:48","59:50",1,"Matt Khoury"
"Let's see, before we get into I talked about okay, yeah.","59:51","59:55",1,"Matt Khoury"
"We can talk Apple Watch right now.","59:55","59:57",1,"Matt Khoury"
"Ben, I know that was on your agenda.","59:57","59:59",1,"Matt Khoury"
"I can tell you where we're at with the firming up of what the Apple Watch program is.","01:00:00","01:00:09",1,"Matt Khoury"
"I think that's what you were poking at.","01:00:09","01:00:12",1,"Matt Khoury"
"Right?","01:00:12","01:00:13",1,"Matt Khoury"
"I had team that was involved in this.","01:00:15","01:00:19",0,"Ben Camper"
"Please keep me honest.","01:00:19","01:00:20",0,"Ben Camper"
"I had a note here that said ultimately we wanted to put for we wanted to create a communication on dashboard of like a reminder for the Apple Watch program.","01:00:20","01:00:32",0,"Ben Camper"
"before we shared it, we wanted to get a really firm point of view on nailing all the specifics.","01:00:32","01:00:39",0,"Ben Camper"
"Is that right, everybody?","01:00:39","01:00:40",0,"Ben Camper"
"Yes.","01:00:40","01:00:41",2,"Nigel Skiathitis"
"Okay.","01:00:41","01:00:41",0,"Ben Camper"
"That sounds right to me.","01:00:41","01:00:43",1,"Matt Khoury"
"The team and I collaborated on this burn it to earn it program.","01:00:45","01:00:51",1,"Matt Khoury"
"It's not just a terms and condition, but it is a program overview.","01:00:53","01:00:57",1,"Matt Khoury"
"I think most like keep me honest, guys.","01:00:57","01:01:01",1,"Matt Khoury"
"But Mary, I think you've seen it.","01:01:01","01:01:02",1,"Matt Khoury"
"Nigel, I think you've seen it.","01:01:02","01:01:04",1,"Matt Khoury"
"I don't know who else has seen it.","01:01:04","01:01:06",1,"Matt Khoury"
"Ian has.","01:01:07","01:01:08",1,"Matt Khoury"
"I've gotten bits and pieces of feedback from folks and just applied it here to kind of firm up our understanding about what the Apple Watch program is.","01:01:10","01:01:23",1,"Matt Khoury"
"that's one piece, the second piece is trueing up how we apply the credits.","01:01:24","01:01:31",1,"Matt Khoury"
"I can tell you that Ian and Sylvia are actively going back and forth just to make sure that the query that he uses to pull members and apply the credit is airtight to ensure that only members who have an Apple Watch are going to get the credit.","01:01:31","01:01:58",1,"Matt Khoury"
"It is just as easy as updating the query, but there's also some regression in there just to make sure that they didn't miss anything.","01:02:00","01:02:10",1,"Matt Khoury"
"that's still being firmed up and it obviously won't continue until Ian gets back.","01:02:10","01:02:17",1,"Matt Khoury"
"The final thing was dashboard communication.","01:02:24","01:02:26",1,"Matt Khoury"
"I don't know that anything's been posted yet on that.","01:02:26","01:02:29",1,"Matt Khoury"
"No, and it's a good call out.","01:02:30","01:02:31",8,"Mary Vicario"
"I want to add in, I know that there's an appetite to have a conversation around purpose of this program and does it hit the mark, some exploration that we probably need to do as a team this work.","01:02:32","01:02:44",8,"Mary Vicario"
"Matt, thanks so much for all your support here was just to make sure that the way we've communicated this program is in alignment with how we're executing it.","01:02:44","01:02:53",8,"Mary Vicario"
"It is by no means saying that this is the right program or this is our future state.","01:02:54","01:03:00",8,"Mary Vicario"
"It's just, hey, we've communicated this program as a we need to execute it as a matt, I appreciate all the work you've done there.","01:03:00","01:03:08",8,"Mary Vicario"
"I think to your point, this probably belongs in the dashboard.","01:03:09","01:03:13",8,"Mary Vicario"
"we can just put a quick note in the beat that says, hey, guys, we've heard from you that there's been some discrepancies, and we just want to make sure we're communicating out to you that we've reassessed the way we apply the credits, and here's the program, and more to come in the future.","01:03:13","01:03:31",8,"Mary Vicario"
"I'm done.","01:03:40","01:03:41",1,"Matt Khoury"
"Matt, I think as we think through a next step on this, holt had pinged me from Apple on this and I think we got to press them to help us find more value in this program.","01:03:42","01:04:00",0,"Ben Camper"
"I don't know if we're really uncovering a lot of value in it.","01:04:01","01:04:04",0,"Ben Camper"
"now the good news is we I think we've dreamt a lot.","01:04:04","01:04:09",0,"Ben Camper"
"We've mitigated our risk quite a bit from where it was.","01:04:09","01:04:11",0,"Ben Camper"
"We probably had more value in the previous program.","01:04:11","01:04:14",0,"Ben Camper"
"That'd be my guess.","01:04:14","01:04:15",0,"Ben Camper"
"We had more value but also way more risk.","01:04:15","01:04:17",0,"Ben Camper"
"branches weren't going to do it, but I don't know.","01:04:17","01:04:23",0,"Ben Camper"
"The most valuable company in the world.","01:04:24","01:04:26",0,"Ben Camper"
"This is like their program.","01:04:27","01:04:28",0,"Ben Camper"
"I think we're executing as we've designed it, but I think we should involve them in how we may want to execute it better or not execute better, but redesign it just doesn't feel like it packs the punch that we'd like it to have.","01:04:29","01:04:42",0,"Ben Camper"
"What would that narrative look like with Halt?","01:04:43","01:04:49",1,"Matt Khoury"
"How would that sound?","01:04:49","01:04:51",1,"Matt Khoury"
"How would you frame it?","01:04:51","01:04:53",1,"Matt Khoury"
"Yeah, that's where my head immediately goes to is for us to identify a metric that we're trying to drive to me to increase lifetime value or is it usage?","01:04:53","01:05:18",0,"Ben Camper"
"it percent of members that let's just say this, let's say it's percent of members that hit a threshold, or percent of members that do a certain amount of visits and then we could idea with them like, hey, can you help us design a program that could drive that metric more?","01:05:18","01:05:36",0,"Ben Camper"
"That's where my head goes to Ben.","01:05:38","01:05:42",0,"Ben Camper"
"I'd also like to tag on the training tool and resources.","01:05:42","01:05:45",8,"Mary Vicario"
"I think part of why let's just call it a gap for sure is the studios execute this inconsistently from studio to studio.","01:05:45","01:05:55",8,"Mary Vicario"
"I'm not even sure that our team members 50% of the time talk about this program when they're onboarding a new member or selling a membership.","01:05:56","01:06:04",8,"Mary Vicario"
"if they were to, I don't know that there's a consistent way that they talk about this program.","01:06:04","01:06:10",8,"Mary Vicario"
"so, on our side, I don't think we've done a great job of building the tools and resources and operationalizing it in a streamlined way.","01:06:11","01:06:18",8,"Mary Vicario"
"Cool.","01:06:26","01:06:27",2,"Nigel Skiathitis"
"Thanks for your time, guys.","01:06:27","01:06:29",1,"Matt Khoury"
"Matt, do you have the next steps on Apple?","01:06:30","01:06:34",0,"Ben Camper"
"Are you good with.","01:06:34","01:06:35",0,"Ben Camper"
"Reach out to Holt?","01:06:37","01:06:39",1,"Matt Khoury"
"I could put some thought into what that metric is.","01:06:42","01:06:48",1,"Matt Khoury"
"Do we have the most urgent next step of communicating the current program to our member base?","01:06:49","01:06:55",0,"Ben Camper"
"I got that.","01:06:56","01:06:57",8,"Mary Vicario"
"You got that?","01:06:57","01:06:58",0,"Ben Camper"
"Okay.","01:06:58","01:06:58",2,"Nigel Skiathitis"
"Mary's?","01:06:58","01:06:58",0,"Ben Camper"
"Got that.","01:06:58","01:06:59",0,"Ben Camper"
"So here's current state.","01:06:59","01:07:01",0,"Ben Camper"
"Here's what it is.","01:07:01","01:07:02",0,"Ben Camper"
"Future program.","01:07:02","01:07:02",0,"Ben Camper"
"We can run that work stream concurrently.","01:07:02","01:07:04",0,"Ben Camper"
"Yeah, Matt, I think put some thought into what would be a metric, maybe bring it back to the group.","01:07:07","01:07:12",0,"Ben Camper"
"We can add to the problem solving next week.","01:07:12","01:07:15",0,"Ben Camper"
"Okay.","01:07:15","01:07:16",2,"Nigel Skiathitis"
"we can reach out to hold anybody else from Apple.","01:07:17","01:07:20",0,"Ben Camper"
"We want to be strategic.","01:07:20","01:07:22",0,"Ben Camper"
"We might want to think just timing and sequencing based on the other Apple conversations going on with AF.","01:07:22","01:07:26",0,"Ben Camper"
"I don't want to muddy that up.","01:07:26","01:07:28",0,"Ben Camper"
"we might want to hold it .","01:07:28","01:07:30",0,"Ben Camper"
"I think that next meeting got pushed to May.","01:07:30","01:07:32",0,"Ben Camper"
"Okay.","01:07:34","01:07:34",1,"Matt Khoury"
"We'll do.","01:07:35","01:07:36",2,"Nigel Skiathitis"
"Cool.","01:07:37","01:07:37",2,"Nigel Skiathitis"
"Anybody else has anything else before we go into problem solving topics?","01:07:41","01:07:45",0,"Ben Camper"
"Good.","01:07:50","01:07:51",2,"Nigel Skiathitis"
"Matt, I did send you over a one pager for a product development submission, and so hopefully we get on the agenda for next week.","01:07:54","01:08:06",0,"Ben Camper"
"Nice.","01:08:07","01:08:08",1,"Matt Khoury"
"All right, mary, you had two here.","01:08:11","01:08:14",0,"Ben Camper"
"I think you might have been out one of the weeks, and we didn't get to the next week, so I might botch the context of it, but it was base camp support, ticket ownership, and feedback.","01:08:14","01:08:24",0,"Ben Camper"
"Yeah.","01:08:25","01:08:26",8,"Mary Vicario"
"Thanks, Ben.","01:08:26","01:08:27",8,"Mary Vicario"
"I'm going to kick it off by, first of all, saying that the firm to the response and resolution of tickets from, let's call it 30 days ago today is incredible.","01:08:27","01:08:42",8,"Mary Vicario"
"It just kind of speaks to getting the ticket in the right team members hands how quickly we can resolve some of these issues.","01:08:42","01:08:49",8,"Mary Vicario"
"I think the other thing that's bubbled up and Matt, we've seen it a lot with the tech side is being able to identify trends so that when we can understand, hey, this isn't just a single studio issue.","01:08:49","01:09:01",8,"Mary Vicario"
"This is a larger issue, and we're quicker to resolve it.","01:09:01","01:09:04",8,"Mary Vicario"
"These are the benefits of putting the ticketing system in our hands.","01:09:04","01:09:08",8,"Mary Vicario"
"I do know that we are not technically support people, and so there's been a learning curve around that.","01:09:08","01:09:14",8,"Mary Vicario"
"I shot.","01:09:14","01:09:15",8,"Mary Vicario"
"Out a quick email just to freshen everybody up on, like, hey, you get a ticket here's what to do.","01:09:15","01:09:21",8,"Mary Vicario"
"Here are SLAs.","01:09:21","01:09:22",8,"Mary Vicario"
"If you guys have questions about that, let me know.","01:09:22","01:09:25",8,"Mary Vicario"
"Matt I've got some work with Matt Olsen on being able to kind of really break down in studio technology further so that the right requests are going to the right people.","01:09:26","01:09:36",8,"Mary Vicario"
"Carrie I think there's an argument for doing the same in marketing.","01:09:36","01:09:41",8,"Mary Vicario"
"And then the last component.","01:09:43","01:09:44",8,"Mary Vicario"
"I know Ian is not on the call, but I am considering taking Mariana Tech out from Ian and actually filtering all Mariana Tech requests and brand bot requests to explore directly, just based off of what I'm learning that Wax is doing with Zenodi.","01:09:44","01:10:00",8,"Mary Vicario"
"I just want to give you a couple of quick updates and just thank you.","01:10:00","01:10:04",8,"Mary Vicario"
"I don't know that you're getting the feedback necessarily from the franchisees, but I think as of Friday, we had 14 total tickets in the system, which is huge improvement.","01:10:04","01:10:14",8,"Mary Vicario"
"That doesn't count as a problem solving topic.","01:10:26","01:10:28",0,"Ben Camper"
"Sorry, Ben, the problem solving was earlier around the steps to resolve, but I shot that in an email, so I don't know that we need to belabor in with the conversation now.","01:10:31","01:10:41",8,"Mary Vicario"
"Now you've set up whoever else is next on the problem solving, is that you got to follow Mary's complimentary topic.","01:10:41","01:10:47",0,"Ben Camper"
"You said that I've got two topics.","01:10:49","01:10:51",8,"Mary Vicario"
"I was going to put Nigel on the hook to talk about cancellations, which I thought was a nice bridge from compliments to cancellations.","01:10:52","01:10:57",0,"Ben Camper"
"Mary won't.","01:10:59","01:11:00",0,"Ben Camper"
"Nigel, you're up next.","01:11:01","01:11:02",0,"Ben Camper"
"No compliments for this one.","01:11:04","01:11:06",2,"Nigel Skiathitis"
"All right, so this is what I wanted to propose to the group.","01:11:07","01:11:10",2,"Nigel Skiathitis"
"at a current state of how a member cancel a membership is matt could be an active member of Woodbury and North Loop, could cancel their membership for that membership.","01:11:10","01:11:26",2,"Nigel Skiathitis"
"That is the current state.","01:11:26","01:11:28",2,"Nigel Skiathitis"
"regardless of where you are a paying member, any other studio could cancel the membership.","01:11:28","01:11:33",2,"Nigel Skiathitis"
"Issues I could see arising from this are membership flipping.","01:11:35","01:11:39",2,"Nigel Skiathitis"
"So, hey, I'll cancel your membership over there.","01:11:39","01:11:41",2,"Nigel Skiathitis"
"I could sign you up on this deal over here.","01:11:41","01:11:44",2,"Nigel Skiathitis"
"You look at a market like Minneapolis that is continuing to densify.","01:11:44","01:11:48",2,"Nigel Skiathitis"
"You look at a future state where you're going to have a burling game and a franchise location 2.8 miles away.","01:11:48","01:11:56",2,"Nigel Skiathitis"
"It opens up the door for some of that.","01:11:56","01:11:59",2,"Nigel Skiathitis"
"What could that do for a member experience?","01:11:59","01:12:01",2,"Nigel Skiathitis"
"Well, now all of a sudden, they're caught in the middle where all of a sudden that old studio reaches out like, hey, Matt, I saw that you have a membership canceled, but you have a new membership.","01:12:01","01:12:09",2,"Nigel Skiathitis"
"Like, what's up?","01:12:09","01:12:10",2,"Nigel Skiathitis"
"That could be weird for a member and kind of getting into the middle of that shuffle here's kind of what I'm proposing, and I wanted to bring it to this group before any conversations with Ian.","01:12:10","01:12:25",2,"Nigel Skiathitis"
"He's obviously not on.","01:12:25","01:12:26",2,"Nigel Skiathitis"
"I have a few questions for Ian, but before we get there is to set up the system so that the studio where it is being paid is where the membership could be canceled.","01:12:26","01:12:40",2,"Nigel Skiathitis"
"if I'm a member of Woodbury can cancel my membership.","01:12:41","01:12:44",2,"Nigel Skiathitis"
"If I'm a member of Burlingame Burling game cancel my membership.","01:12:44","01:12:48",2,"Nigel Skiathitis"
"that would be the member reaching out directly to the studio that they have their membership with, working with that owner studio manager team to cancel their membership.","01:12:48","01:13:00",2,"Nigel Skiathitis"
"That is what I'm proposing.","01:13:00","01:13:02",2,"Nigel Skiathitis"
"I'm going to pause there, pick it apart.","01:13:02","01:13:05",2,"Nigel Skiathitis"
"Let's talk through that.","01:13:05","01:13:07",2,"Nigel Skiathitis"
"I think this is a great call out.","01:13:10","01:13:12",4,"Katy DiIorio"
"I think even when I was a studio manager, I was starting to experience it, and we just kind of went off a golden rule, treat others how you want to be treated.","01:13:12","01:13:22",4,"Katy DiIorio"
"we paid courtesy and just called the other studio and said, hey, they're primarily coming to this location now.","01:13:22","01:13:28",4,"Katy DiIorio"
"What can we do?","01:13:29","01:13:30",4,"Katy DiIorio"
"Number one, great call out on this one.","01:13:31","01:13:33",4,"Katy DiIorio"
"I think it's only going to continue growing as a nuisance as we grow up studios, as you've noted as well.","01:13:34","01:13:42",4,"Katy DiIorio"
"I think for me, the first step would be figuring out what Mariana Tech.","01:13:42","01:13:48",4,"Katy DiIorio"
"Can do with Ian or Ian can.","01:13:48","01:13:52",8,"Mary Vicario"
"Do with what we can do with Mariana Tech.","01:13:52","01:13:54",4,"Katy DiIorio"
"there a way where we can just narrow that field of what people can see, in a mind body version, but like an upgraded 2.0 where they can still see certain things, but they can't cancel them?","01:13:55","01:14:10",4,"Katy DiIorio"
"That would be my first question.","01:14:11","01:14:13",4,"Katy DiIorio"
"The rest of it, I'd have to continue giving it more thought, but I'm a big fan of what you're proposing.","01:14:14","01:14:20",4,"Katy DiIorio"
"Nigel, how big of a problem is this.","01:14:20","01:14:24",1,"Matt Khoury"
"Look?","01:14:26","01:14:26",2,"Nigel Skiathitis"
"I think I look and right now, corporate owned studios in the same market, and maybe you look at a Madison market, that it's all one owner, and that limits it.","01:14:26","01:14:40",2,"Nigel Skiathitis"
"Minneapolis is really you're already starting to see it, where now we have two corporate owned locations.","01:14:40","01:14:46",2,"Nigel Skiathitis"
"We're about to have two franchise locations with the rights to three more already sold and in waiting.","01:14:46","01:14:54",2,"Nigel Skiathitis"
"now you'll have three different owners and two corporate studios in the same market.","01:14:54","01:15:00",2,"Nigel Skiathitis"
"I look at the Chicago market as that continues to develop, even how close it is to Madison.","01:15:00","01:15:05",2,"Nigel Skiathitis"
"They've had some crossover, I think, about San Diego and Northern California.","01:15:05","01:15:13",2,"Nigel Skiathitis"
"As we continue to densify markets, this will become more and more of a topic.","01:15:13","01:15:17",2,"Nigel Skiathitis"
"just know, like, I've already had owners and Chrissy reach out to me on this topic of, like, hey, how's this work?","01:15:17","01:15:26",2,"Nigel Skiathitis"
"can someone just cancel the membership and switch over?","01:15:26","01:15:30",2,"Nigel Skiathitis"
"Can I give you an idea?","01:15:31","01:15:32",4,"Katy DiIorio"
"It's not a huge problem right now.","01:15:32","01:15:34",4,"Katy DiIorio"
"It is becoming one, and it's only going to become one even more.","01:15:34","01:15:39",4,"Katy DiIorio"
"I think this is the time to really start looking at what are solutions so that we have it in place as we continue to densify our different markets.","01:15:39","01:15:47",4,"Katy DiIorio"
"on top of it too, our franchisees or corporate locations are getting merits based on new sales and things like that, or number of cancellations, whatever.","01:15:47","01:16:00",4,"Katy DiIorio"
"It could be the four KPI targets.","01:16:00","01:16:03",4,"Katy DiIorio"
"Then that makes a difference.","01:16:03","01:16:06",4,"Katy DiIorio"
"And so it gets a little roof.","01:16:06","01:16:08",4,"Katy DiIorio"
"Nigel, what would the consumer experience be with what you're proposing?","01:16:10","01:16:15",8,"Mary Vicario"
"They would reach out to the studio that they have a membership with, and if they'd like to cancel that membership, they would work directly with the studio in which they open their membership with.","01:16:15","01:16:26",2,"Nigel Skiathitis"
"Just quickly.","01:16:27","01:16:28",8,"Mary Vicario"
"This scenario that you're talking about is I walk into Apple Valley and say, hey, I want to cancel.","01:16:28","01:16:35",8,"Mary Vicario"
"they say, Sorry, you need to reach out to Woodbury for cancellation.","01:16:35","01:16:40",8,"Mary Vicario"
"Yes.","01:16:41","01:16:41",2,"Nigel Skiathitis"
"any cancellation, you can either email or call the studio that you have your membership with, and we'll be able to take care of that process for you.","01:16:41","01:16:49",2,"Nigel Skiathitis"
"Got it.","01:16:50","01:16:50",8,"Mary Vicario"
"if somebody say, Apple Valley opens and say, hey, I really like this studio, I'm wondering if this is also a question of reciprocity, which I know we started working through, Ben, but is that part of what you're trying to tackle here?","01:16:51","01:17:08",8,"Mary Vicario"
"Yes.","01:17:08","01:17:08",2,"Nigel Skiathitis"
"So, look, even if we say do the right thing.","01:17:08","01:17:12",2,"Nigel Skiathitis"
"Right.","01:17:12","01:17:12",2,"Nigel Skiathitis"
"I'm going to be working on it at Edina.","01:17:13","01:17:15",2,"Nigel Skiathitis"
"So I'm going to pay Edina.","01:17:15","01:17:17",2,"Nigel Skiathitis"
"That person is going to need to cancel that membership and reset up a new membership with Edina for Edina to collect that revenue.","01:17:18","01:17:28",2,"Nigel Skiathitis"
"even in this process of do the right thing, they're going to be working out here.","01:17:28","01:17:33",2,"Nigel Skiathitis"
"The membership needs to be canceled and a new membership needs to be set up.","01:17:33","01:17:38",2,"Nigel Skiathitis"
"With the way Mariana Tech is currently structured, there's no way to transfer a membership to a new studio.","01:17:38","01:17:46",2,"Nigel Skiathitis"
"Yeah.","01:17:46","01:17:47",8,"Mary Vicario"
"that's kind of where I was going.","01:17:47","01:17:49",8,"Mary Vicario"
"I wonder if the work belongs on our vendor to make this a smooth experience for our consumer and also for our owner.","01:17:49","01:17:59",8,"Mary Vicario"
"Yeah.","01:18:00","01:18:00",2,"Nigel Skiathitis"
"I had questions written down for Ian on, like, what would we need to do in Mariana Tech, and is this even a capability that exists in Mariana Tech right now?","01:18:01","01:18:13",2,"Nigel Skiathitis"
"I think there's some understanding, but before I got there and started that work, I wanted to align this group and make sure that I didn't have any blind spots.","01:18:13","01:18:24",2,"Nigel Skiathitis"
"Am I missing something?","01:18:24","01:18:25",2,"Nigel Skiathitis"
"Are we creating a negative experience in some way, shape, or form for the consumer by moving this?","01:18:25","01:18:32",2,"Nigel Skiathitis"
"Which my personal take is that it does protect the consumer from getting in the crosshairs a bit.","01:18:32","01:18:39",2,"Nigel Skiathitis"
"there a rule written somewhere where I can't cancel my membership and go to another studio and just open another one?","01:18:41","01:18:49",1,"Matt Khoury"
"So then what's the big deal then?","01:18:51","01:18:54",1,"Matt Khoury"
"If I guess I'm still trying to.","01:18:54","01:18:56",1,"Matt Khoury"
"Imagine I'm overseeing Edina and someone is a member at North Loop, but they primarily only come to Edina, and I go and I cancel that member from North Loop and re sign them up in Edina so that I get the profits for it without telling you.","01:18:57","01:19:12",4,"Katy DiIorio"
"In North Loop, that's where the tricky part becomes people aren't always following the golden rule and then it becomes, well, whose member are they really?","01:19:12","01:19:21",4,"Katy DiIorio"
"I'm the one that worked to sell them, but they only come here now.","01:19:21","01:19:24",4,"Katy DiIorio"
"It helps alleviate that part of it.","01:19:25","01:19:27",4,"Katy DiIorio"
"My counterargument to that is, okay, so we may get more friction filled for the consumer and they can still do that anyway.","01:19:27","01:19:36",1,"Matt Khoury"
"They can walk into their old studio and cancel it and go over to Edina and take out a new membership.","01:19:36","01:19:41",1,"Matt Khoury"
"Matt yeah, good question.","01:19:42","01:19:44",2,"Nigel Skiathitis"
"let's say Apple Valley is in presale.","01:19:44","01:19:48",2,"Nigel Skiathitis"
"I'm a Woodbury member and I'm like, oh, I saw that deal.","01:19:50","01:19:55",2,"Nigel Skiathitis"
"I'm not going to be changing where I work out.","01:19:55","01:19:57",2,"Nigel Skiathitis"
"Woodbury is like, great, I'll cancel your membership over there.","01:19:57","01:20:00",2,"Nigel Skiathitis"
"I'll sell you a membership here.","01:20:00","01:20:02",2,"Nigel Skiathitis"
"You keep working out over there.","01:20:02","01:20:03",2,"Nigel Skiathitis"
"I know what you're talking about.","01:20:05","01:20:07",1,"Matt Khoury"
"Jenna may never even realize it, or it may be a year before she realizes that this person she's servicing this member on a regular basis, but she's not collecting any of the revenues from it.","01:20:07","01:20:17",2,"Nigel Skiathitis"
"that's where AF has like their reciprocity rules built in by you go to a club a certain amount of time.","01:20:17","01:20:28",1,"Matt Khoury"
"I don't remember what the thresholds are, but let's just say the majority of your visits in the last two months are at a club other than your home club.","01:20:29","01:20:36",1,"Matt Khoury"
"Then that studio owner can behind this.","01:20:37","01:20:40",1,"Matt Khoury"
"Sorry, club owner can behind the scenes claim you.","01:20:40","01:20:43",1,"Matt Khoury"
"there has to be rules met that's AFLand.","01:20:44","01:20:50",1,"Matt Khoury"
"But, yeah.","01:20:50","01:20:54",1,"Matt Khoury"
"Again, this it allows for agenda to say, hey, I can just I'll match that rate for you, so don't worry about the price.","01:20:58","01:21:07",2,"Nigel Skiathitis"
"I'll change your membership rate.","01:21:08","01:21:09",2,"Nigel Skiathitis"
"You're not missing out or losing anything and you're staying here versus Jenna never knowing that it happened.","01:21:09","01:21:16",2,"Nigel Skiathitis"
"Jenna spent the marketing dollars, the labor hours, everything to convert that member and without knowing, she just lost a membership.","01:21:17","01:21:29",2,"Nigel Skiathitis"
"Flipping is a real thing.","01:21:29","01:21:30",2,"Nigel Skiathitis"
"I dealt with it when I was in Santa Monica with West Hollywood and Pasadena and 24 Hours Fitness.","01:21:30","01:21:36",2,"Nigel Skiathitis"
"It was a real thing.","01:21:36","01:21:37",2,"Nigel Skiathitis"
"Thing to consider, Nigel, is if or when we ever get around to a big if we ever get around to sell memberships online or in the app.","01:21:38","01:21:46",1,"Matt Khoury"
"Right.","01:21:47","01:21:47",1,"Matt Khoury"
"they have to have a way to cancel that without talking to anybody.","01:21:47","01:21:51",1,"Matt Khoury"
"But it's not an issue now.","01:21:56","01:21:58",1,"Matt Khoury"
"It's just throwing it out there for reaction.","01:21:58","01:22:02",1,"Matt Khoury"
"Yeah.","01:22:03","01:22:04",2,"Nigel Skiathitis"
"To me, it's like, I signed up with you, I'll cancel with you.","01:22:04","01:22:08",2,"Nigel Skiathitis"
"during that process, that gives the owner or the studios an opportunity to learn why they're losing a member.","01:22:09","01:22:16",2,"Nigel Skiathitis"
"someone could be canceling their membership without ever giving that studio or team an opportunity to keep them and give that member what they want.","01:22:18","01:22:29",2,"Nigel Skiathitis"
"Yeah.","01:22:32","01:22:33",1,"Matt Khoury"
"Again, in the cancellation process, I can't tell you how many people I was able to save just by talking through with them.","01:22:33","01:22:42",4,"Katy DiIorio"
"It ended up like, majority of the time just being like a freeze instead of a cancellation, and they just thought they had to cancel.","01:22:43","01:22:52",4,"Katy DiIorio"
"Again.","01:22:55","01:22:55",8,"Mary Vicario"
"I'm a big fan of trying to put it back on our vendor and seeing what Mariana Tech can do and.","01:22:55","01:23:01",4,"Katy DiIorio"
"Then.","01:23:01","01:23:01",8,"Mary Vicario"
"Just coming up with some, I think some mindful, like a very mindful process.","01:23:05","01:23:13",4,"Katy DiIorio"
"I don't know.","01:23:17","01:23:18",4,"Katy DiIorio"
"Again, I think we just need to.","01:23:18","01:23:19",4,"Katy DiIorio"
"Take a look at reciprocity, Matt.","01:23:19","01:23:21",8,"Mary Vicario"
"I think it's a good call out.","01:23:21","01:23:23",2,"Nigel Skiathitis"
"Like the reciprocity piece, I think is a piece of this.","01:23:23","01:23:26",2,"Nigel Skiathitis"
"And what is that consumer experience?","01:23:26","01:23:29",2,"Nigel Skiathitis"
"I think it's us eventually making a decision.","01:23:29","01:23:32",2,"Nigel Skiathitis"
"Is that a buy class?","01:23:32","01:23:34",2,"Nigel Skiathitis"
"Is it once a majority?","01:23:34","01:23:35",2,"Nigel Skiathitis"
"There's some vendor work because right now, Mariana Tech does not have the capability to say, matt, you have an active membership here, you are moving there and we will transfer that membership over for you.","01:23:36","01:23:49",2,"Nigel Skiathitis"
"Right now, that user experience isn't great because whether it's a twelve month or a month to month, it needs to be canceled and reset up with the new studio.","01:23:49","01:23:59",2,"Nigel Skiathitis"
"there's definitely some questions in here for Ian and do these capabilities exist?","01:23:59","01:24:07",2,"Nigel Skiathitis"
"if they don't, are they even on the roadmap?","01:24:07","01:24:09",2,"Nigel Skiathitis"
"part B of that is, do we want them to prioritize that work over the other things that we're asking for that are more impactful on driving revenue?","01:24:09","01:24:20",2,"Nigel Skiathitis"
"The consumer experience is a great when you cancel out one income to another, you can't just transfer the credit card.","01:24:21","01:24:27",4,"Katy DiIorio"
"You know what I mean?","01:24:27","01:24:28",8,"Mary Vicario"
"Like, you have to reenter it all back in and stuff.","01:24:28","01:24:31",4,"Katy DiIorio"
"Do you?","01:24:34","01:24:34",2,"Nigel Skiathitis"
"If they're not in your system, maybe it's Jane, since I've been studio manager.","01:24:36","01:24:41",4,"Katy DiIorio"
"But.","01:24:41","01:24:42",2,"Nigel Skiathitis"
"Nigel, do you mind if I ask a question?","01:24:45","01:24:47",8,"Mary Vicario"
"I don't want to extend this if it doesn't need to be, but what should the consumer experience be, or our franchise experience, depending on how you want to kind of build the model and then go from there.","01:24:49","01:25:00",8,"Mary Vicario"
"Because what I'm hearing is consumer walks into any studio and says, hey, I want to cancel my membership.","01:25:00","01:25:07",8,"Mary Vicario"
"What we really want to do is save them no matter what studio they're in, rather than redirect them.","01:25:07","01:25:15",8,"Mary Vicario"
"We do.","01:25:17","01:25:18",2,"Nigel Skiathitis"
"right now we're asking the consumer to either fill out a form or submit an email for that request as is, because we don't want a frontline team member that works 4 hours a week trying to address that conversation.","01:25:18","01:25:39",2,"Nigel Skiathitis"
"We want someone closer that has skin in the game, that has experience with that conversation, navigating that conversation.","01:25:40","01:25:49",2,"Nigel Skiathitis"
"Yeah, I get that.","01:25:49","01:25:50",8,"Mary Vicario"
"I'm just wondering if I walk into Studio B and I'm a member at Studio A and say, hey, I want to cancel my membership, can Studio B submit message to Mariana Tech that paying Studio A and says, hey, members, request to cancel.","01:25:50","01:26:04",8,"Mary Vicario"
"Can you reach out to them?","01:26:04","01:26:05",8,"Mary Vicario"
"I'm wondering if there's an opportunity for us to think maybe differently and leverage our vendors to do some of that work.","01:26:06","01:26:14",8,"Mary Vicario"
"I don't know.","01:26:15","01:26:16",8,"Mary Vicario"
"I'm just spitballing the other thing that.","01:26:16","01:26:19",8,"Mary Vicario"
"Kind of came to mind, which makes me think that figuring out the reciprocity is also just really the answer is, aside from cancellation, let's think because this is happening in Minnesota right now.","01:26:19","01:26:31",6,"Carrie Konosky"
"there's a client from Woodbury who doesn't really like all the coaches anymore, and she's been coming to North Loop every day, the two classes in the morning.","01:26:31","01:26:40",6,"Carrie Konosky"
"Now, let's say these are two franchisees, and that happens for a period of time.","01:26:40","01:26:46",6,"Carrie Konosky"
"She's taking space at a packed class, and that studio is not getting any revenue for at least a month.","01:26:46","01:26:53",6,"Carrie Konosky"
"I think that's, again, it comes back to the system.","01:26:54","01:26:56",6,"Carrie Konosky"
"there a way that you can see where they are taking most of the classes?","01:26:56","01:27:01",6,"Carrie Konosky"
"Does that make sense?","01:27:01","01:27:02",6,"Carrie Konosky"
"Guys, we're right at time, so let's do this.","01:27:03","01:27:06",0,"Ben Camper"
"It sounds like there's an appetite to solve what we're proposing to solve here, which is finding a way to enable the home studio to control and be aware of what member behaviors requests may be cancellations.","01:27:06","01:27:26",0,"Ben Camper"
"I want to move to a different studio, whatever that is.","01:27:26","01:27:28",0,"Ben Camper"
"I think there's a lot of open questions of what's the best way to do that.","01:27:28","01:27:31",0,"Ben Camper"
"Ideal consumer experience, how can we unlock what from the vendor, all those use cases.","01:27:31","01:27:36",0,"Ben Camper"
"I want to be cognizant of the intent of it.","01:27:36","01:27:39",0,"Ben Camper"
"Nigel, do you have enough to take the next steps on this?","01:27:39","01:27:42",0,"Ben Camper"
"I think so.","01:27:45","01:27:46",2,"Nigel Skiathitis"
"Mary, I have down your note around a communication piece.","01:27:47","01:27:50",2,"Nigel Skiathitis"
"it something that could be automated where hey, this studios request this members requesting a cancellation and it pings that team.","01:27:50","01:27:59",2,"Nigel Skiathitis"
"In the short term, could it be like that studio just sends an email to the other studio?","01:27:59","01:28:04",2,"Nigel Skiathitis"
"There's also understanding from Mariana Tech what is possible as is.","01:28:04","01:28:10",2,"Nigel Skiathitis"
"there a way to lock down to where one studio is, the studio that owns that processing of the actual cancellation?","01:28:10","01:28:18",2,"Nigel Skiathitis"
"And I think there's the reciprocity.","01:28:19","01:28:21",2,"Nigel Skiathitis"
"One to me is a juggernaut of work to do before we get there.","01:28:21","01:28:28",2,"Nigel Skiathitis"
"I think the other questions are more for Ian related to Mariana Tech and what is possible and what would need to happen once I collect that information.","01:28:28","01:28:47",2,"Nigel Skiathitis"
"I don't know how long.","01:28:50","01:28:51",2,"Nigel Skiathitis"
"I know it's out for a couple of days for Rivers birthday, but I'll shoot him some questions and gather some information and we can read next week as a group, and I can give an update and we can continue the conversation about cool.","01:28:51","01:29:05",2,"Nigel Skiathitis"
"Good stuff.","01:29:05","01:29:06",0,"Ben Camper"
"Mary, I'm assuming you want to do a quick plug on the QBR needs.","01:29:07","01:29:14",0,"Ben Camper"
"Yes, I can shoot out an email.","01:29:14","01:29:17",8,"Mary Vicario"
"Ben, no problem.","01:29:17","01:29:18",8,"Mary Vicario"
"Awesome.","01:29:18","01:29:19",0,"Ben Camper"
"We got it next Wednesday.","01:29:19","01:29:20",0,"Ben Camper"
"looking forward to doing it all, everybody.","01:29:20","01:29:23",0,"Ben Camper"
"Good chat.","01:29:23","01:29:23",0,"Ben Camper"
"Today.","01:29:23","01:29:24",0,"Ben Camper"
"Thank you.","01:29:24","01:29:24",0,"Ben Camper"
